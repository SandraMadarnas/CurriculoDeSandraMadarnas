Si no seguiríamos allí.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Sin duda es algo a tener en cuenta para replicar en próximas ediciones.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Algunos datos de WordCamp Sevilla 2022</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>En cuanto a algunos datos interesantes, tenemos que el 50% de los asistentes eran la primera vez que asistían a una WordCamp, siendo una gran parte de ellos estudiantes, algo inédito hasta la fecha. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Además también se consiguió un 33% de asistencia femenina, lo cual también supera la media de los eventos celebrados hasta la fecha en Sevilla.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Siempre por supuesto con cosas que mejorar, pero sin duda objetivo cumplido por parte de la organización. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Gente nueva, con ideas nuevas y ganas de hacer cosas.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Ya queda menos para la próxima WordCamp Sevilla. <strong>¡Nos vemos allí!</strong></p>\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:36:\"http://wellformedweb.org/CommentAPI/\";a:1:{s:10:\"commentRss\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:76:\"https://es.wordpress.org/2022/11/25/experiencias-wordcamp-sevilla-2022/feed/\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:38:\"http://purl.org/rss/1.0/modules/slash/\";a:1:{s:8:\"comments\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:1:\"0\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:2;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:73:\"\n		\n		\n					\n		\n		\n		\n				\n		\n\n					\n										\n					\n					\n			\n		\n		\n			\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:5:{s:0:\"\";a:7:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:22:\"State of the Word 2022\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:59:\"https://es.wordpress.org/2022/11/24/state-of-the-word-2022/\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:8:\"comments\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:67:\"https://es.wordpress.org/2022/11/24/state-of-the-word-2022/#respond\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Thu, 24 Nov 2022 08:16:00 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:8:\"category\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:7:\"General\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:34:\"https://es.wordpress.org/?p=142962\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:1:{s:0:\"\";a:1:{s:11:\"isPermaLink\";s:5:\"false\";}}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:174:\"¡State of the Word 2022 ya está en el calendario!

Esta conversación vino siendo así:</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Érica: Te he visto en la lista de voluntarios y quería preguntarte si querrías ayudarnos con las Redes Sociales desde ya.</em></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Pensé en “salir corriendo”. No me llevo muy bien con las redes, me cuesta mucho trabajo crear contenido, nunca creo encontrar las palabras adecuadas para agradecer mensajes y, a veces, me pierdo en el mundo paralelo de las notificaciones, pero bueno, para todo hay una primera vez y me apetecía mucho aportar mi granito de arena en la comunidad.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Yo: Claro Érica, no te preocupes, yo me hago cargo.</em></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Empieza la <em>Falla</em> y la lluvia de accesos, mensajes, reuniones…</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>¡Wow! Todo esto, ¿os lo habéis comido los 6 solos?</em></p>\n\n\n\n<p>A la semana siguiente, no sé en qué momento, me vuelve a llamar Érica, que han pensado que mejor me “Digievolucionan”, que las redes dan mucha guerra y que quieren que me una al equipo. ¡¡Ay, la leche!!</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Ahora sí. Estoy entusiasmada, eufórica, pletórica y, sobre todo, muy asustada. No podía imaginar que organizar un evento de tal magnitud significara tanto sacrificio, en este caso, sacrificio que he visto en todo el equipo. Estrés, pérdida de horas de sueño, debates de una duración superior a lo que había visto hasta ahora y un gran esfuerzo por parte de todos para conseguir conciliar nuestras vidas, nuestros trabajos y la organización de un evento de casi 400 personas de manera totalmente altruista, pero que tenía que ser “una gran <em>Falla</em>”.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Mi experiencia como coordinadora de Redes Sociales en la WordCamp Valencia 2022</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Mi parte de la falla comienza su festejo cuando cojo el relevo de IG, Twitter y… ¡Ostras! No tenemos LinkedIn, que no cunda el pánico. Todo tiene solución.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>El mismo día, me presentan a un equipo de mujeres que han sido parte importantísima en la comunicación vía RRSS de esta WordCampVLC:</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Anabella que desde Argentina era nuestro “turno de noche” y en 4 días llevó la cuenta de LinkedIn a la altura de IG, publicando todo aquello que faltaba. También decir que una vez llegada a Valencia ha sido implacable en redes durante toda la WordCamp. Pudisteis verla sacando fotos con la 360°, con el móvil y porque no le dejamos, si no le quita la cámara a Nilo.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Alba, que con su experiencia nos hizo la vida más fácil con una serie de Copy´s para automatizar algunas cosillas. Su dedicación al trabajo es inspiradora ¿Visteis una mujer pegada al móvil? Era ella, seguro.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Carla Patricia, no había conocido jamás a nadie con tanta ganas de trabajar y de aportar su parte en algo en lo que no va a participar presencialmente. Desde Las Palmas de Gran Canaria nos ha brindado todo su apoyo y cariño, además, durante el streaming se encargó de moderar y hacernos llegar los mensajitos que iba dejando la gente.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Y contando con este pedazo de equipo diréis “<em>Erika (con k), ¿Y tú qué hiciste?</em>”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Yo me encargué de coordinar con el equipo de diseño todas las creatividades, aquí Patricia era mi salvación, dar apoyo en las diferentes redes sociales, contestar mensajes y compartir todo lo que ponentes, patrocinadores y asistentes nos hacían llegar. Y desde aquí me gustaría dar las gracias a todas y a todos por colaborar en la comunicación de este evento.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>El Contributor Day, un antes y un después</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Una cosa es conocer la comunidad WordPress en las MeetUp que se realizan de manera regular, en las que aprendes muchísimo y se crean vínculos y sinergias muy chulas, y otra es ver, estar y participar en un Contributor Day, o Community Day como lo llamamos en WordCamp Valencia.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Mi primer Contributor Day, obvio, ha sido mi primera WordCamp. No tuve manera de participar activamente en ninguna mesa, lo intenté en un par, pero las responsabilidades se me amontonaban y había que cumplir. No, esto no es del todo cierto. No participé en ninguna mesa, pero estuve en todas. ¿Cómo hice esto?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Solo este día se acreditaron 104 personas, y solo el 30% conocían la comunidad, esto propició que el otro 70% estuvieran muy atentos en la presentación de la jornada y les surgieran pequeñas dudas, y una cosa que me encantó es que se acercaran a preguntar para resolverlas. Carne de comunidad.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Así llevé a más de 20 asistentes a la mesa que me habían dicho que les llamaba la atención. Tengo un caso muy presente, el de Alfonso.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Alfonso no conocía la comunidad, llevaba tres semanas trabajando con WordPress y se había enterado de la WordCamp por casualidad. Tuve oportunidad de hablar un poquito con él durante la acreditación y otro poquito después de la presentación, cuando se acercó a preguntarme en qué mesa le recomendaba sentarse.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Sabía que la mesa que presidían Juan y Rocío le vendría muy bien, la mesa de Comunidad. ¿Sabéis qué pasó?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Al final de la jornada pude hablar de nuevo con Alfonso y me anunció repleto de energía que iba a reabrir la MeetUp de Sagunto. No me lo podía creer. De no conocer nada a comprometerse de lleno con la comunidad.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>¡Qué importante es el Contributor Day!</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Día de ponencias</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Creo que este día fue uno de los más complicados para la organización, no el día en sí, pero sí su organización. Sobre todo la elección de las ponencias. Se presentaron más de 60, pero solo podíamos escoger 18. No fue nada fácil. Se buscó un equilibrio en la temática y creo que lo conseguimos.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Mi más sincero agradecimiento a aquellos y aquellas que presentaron su propuesta y, por supuesto, a los que finalmente nos entregaron tanto contenido de valor desde la tarima.Si quieres verlas están todas las grabaciones del día en<a href=\"https://wordpress.tv/event/wordcamp-valencia-2022/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\"> WordPress.Tv</a> o en la página oficial de la<a href=\"https://valencia.wordcamp.org/2022/programa/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\"> WordCamp Valencia 2022</a>, clicando en el título de cada ponencia.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Y con esto me despido</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Tengo una pequeña sensación de vacío después de la WordCamp. Esto me pasa cuando trabajo en algo en lo que creo pero llega a su fin. Aunque en este caso solo es un freno, en WordPress Valencia seguimos con las MeetUp y ya tenemos el foco puesto en WordCamp Valencia 2023, así que ¡atentos!.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>No me puedo despedir sin agradecer a todos los voluntarios su dedicación y compromiso, pero sobre todo, su alegría durante todo el evento (a pesar del cansancio). No tengo palabras.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Gracias también a todos los patrocinadores. Conocer en persona a los representantes de las empresas con las que trabajamos habitualmente siempre es una grata experiencia. Además, ¡trajeron un montón de regalitos chulos!</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Pero sobre todo, gracias a todo el equipo, Érica Aguado, Patricia Navarro, Javier Hernández, Luis Francisco Bautista, Ricardo Vilar y Julián Ruiz. ¿Qué decir de ellos que no haya dicho ya?

Las mejoras adicionales y las mejoras en el editor dan a los propietarios de sitios más control y una personalización más fácil, a la vez que ofrecen una experiencia más cohesionada a los usuarios. La versión incluye muchas mejoras centradas en la escritura, porque si estás dando voz a los sin voz tienes que centrarte en la gente que escribe el texto.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Algunas de mis mejoras favoritas son la posibilidad mejorada de seleccionar párrafos parciales en un bloque; los ajustes para mantener la vista de lista abierta por defecto; y el atajo de teclado para añadir enlaces internos expandidos a todos los bloques.</p>\n<cite>Josepha Haden Chomphosy, Directora Ejecutiva</cite></blockquote>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-buttons is-layout-flex

I&#8217;m your host, Josepha Haden Chomphosy. Here we go.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[Josepha Haden Chomphosy 00:00:40]<br /><br />I have with me today Hécto Prieto. You all may know him from the WordPress Slack. He recently was, I believe, a release coordinator, maybe for the last release. Was that for 6.1?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[Héctor Prieto 00:00:51]<br /><br />Yes. It was for 6.1 and also 6.0, in fact.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[Josepha Haden Chomphosy 00:00:54]<br /><br />All right. Well, welcome to the WordPress Briefing today. How are you doing?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[Héctor Prieto 00:00:59]&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Well, I&#8217;m excited to be here. I&#8217;m a longtime listener of the podcast since the first episode. So I&#8217;m super excited to be here with you today.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[Josepha Haden Chomphosy 00:01:06]<br /><br />Yes. Longtime listener. First-time caller. All right, well, we&#8217;re gonna have a topic that just dumps you right in the soup, as they say in the United States. So we are actually here to talk about phase three of Gutenberg. It&#8217;s been a long time coming, and there are a lot of questions that folks have about what&#8217;s going into it and what&#8217;s not going into it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And as someone who works really closely with our Gutenberg technical architect, Matías Ventura, I figured you would be exactly the right person to come and talk about your favorite things. From your perspective, what is going to be the biggest enhancement that we start to approach in phase three?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Like which thing, which API is gonna take the most work, do you think?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[Héctor Prieto 00:01:53]<br /><br />Well, the most work, that&#8217;s a very hard question to answer because we are still we are going to start an exploration phase to determine how far we want to go with each of these APIs. So, in general, all these APIs and these products are standalone projects. And some of them are shorter, and some of them are longer.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I would say, in general, the real-time collaboration sounds the most technically challenging because of what it represents and all the changes needed to how we interact with WordPress from async to sync, basically. That would be the hardest part. I think there are also already a few prototypes working, but we need to see how that scales, for example.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[Josepha Haden Chomphosy 00:02:32]</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Yeah. So speaking of a few prototypes, I know that there are two or three different prototypes specifically for collaborative editing, but do we have people or groups, working groups in the community that have built any other prototypes? Or is it just kind of first passes at collaborative editing that we&#8217;ve seen?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[Héctor Prieto 00:02:52]<br /><br />Well, apart from Riad Benguella’s exploration, there&#8217;s a public repository with that exploration, there are a few plugins trying the same, trying real-time collaboration.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[Josepha Haden Chomphosy 00:03:03]<br /><br />Yeah, I can think of co-blocks and as blocks, and then I feel like there was a third one.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[Héctor Prieto 00:03:09]&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Yeah.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[Josepha Haden Chomphosy 00:03:09]<br /><br />We&#8217;ll find the links to all these</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[Héctor Prieto 00:03:12]</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Yeah. Let&#8217;s add them to the show notes.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[Josepha Haden Chomphosy 00:03:14]<br /><br />Excellent. So that&#8217;s going to be the biggest one. Is there, of the list of APIs, and this is based on the post that Matías sent out last week. If you all haven&#8217;t seen that, we&#8217;ll put that in the show notes as well. But from the APIs that Matías sort of helped us to identify last week, is there any one that you are particularly excited about for fixing things in WordPress or just generally like an interesting topic of development for you?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[Héctor Prieto 00:03:42]<br /><br />Well, I would say all of them and how they all play together. But, if I need to pick one of them…</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[Josepha Haden Chomphosy 00:03:48]<br /><br />Everything&#8217;s the best!&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[Héctor Prieto 00:03:50]<br /><br />I&#8217;ll cheat anyway, and I will going to pick two out of them because they solve issues at different levels. I&#8217;m very excited about visual revisions. I think it helps a lot of users, and it affects even non-technical users.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So it&#8217;s one of the projects that lower how hard or complex WordPress can be to use sometimes. It&#8217;s going to be a huge improvement. It&#8217;s going to, I mean, bringing blocks to the revision system. I mean, it&#8217;s just a dream come true for me. I&#8217;m also going to highlight the search everywhere or quick search feature Matías already opened an issue in the GitHub repository right now.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[Josepha Haden Chomphosy 00:04:28]<br /><br />Mm-hmm.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[Héctor Prieto 00:04:28]<br /><br />So the idea for this product is to have a power user shortcut that opens searching, an Alfred-like or Spotlight-like interface for those familiar with MacOS operating systems.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>When you can type anything, any place you want to go, or you want to search for any specific text in a document. And it&#8217;s supposed to be your power user command tool. So that you can do most things there.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[Josepha Haden Chomphosy 00:04:53]<br /><br />Oh, and I mean not only power user command tool, but also there are some applications there for folks who have mobility issues, people who are using primarily keyboard as opposed to keyboard and mouse, all that kind of stuff, right?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[Héctor Prieto 00:05:07]<br /><br />Exactly. And just thinking long term with the rise of AI, it could be possible even to add some natural language processing to this interface so that users could just write in, in plain text, in natural language, what they want to do, and WordPress would provide the action for them.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[Josepha Haden Chomphosy 00:05:23]<br /><br />Very nice. My two favorites, since you gave two favorites and I can&#8217;t just give one at that point, my two favorite projects, which are also probably really, really hard projects, are those explorations around fixing notifications. That is a really big project. And one that I think that, in general, the WordPress project is going to be really excited to have some input on.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And so that&#8217;s one that I really will have an eye on. And the other one that I&#8217;m going to definitely have my eye on is the media gallery redesign. I realize that this shows, between you and I, that shows our two specific focuses. Because, of course, you work directly with guiding all of our developers. And I am very much like our user advocate. And WordPress “everyman.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I don&#8217;t know if that&#8217;s a term that makes sense outside the US. But I do a lot of advocacy for folks who are using WordPress from the user side as opposed to from the developer side because, of course, we have a lot of excellent developers. So y&#8217;all don&#8217;t need my help with your advocacy.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But yeah, that really shows that you and I have different focuses, which I think is good too.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[Héctor Prieto 00:06:32]<br /><br />Yes. Also, it’s worth noting that at the end of the day, any improvement we make for developers is so that developers can build better things for users. So, at the end of the day, everything is in the best interest of the users.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[Josepha Haden Chomphosy 00:06:45]&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>That&#8217;s right. That&#8217;s definitely a good point. Yeah. So, a final question about this particular thing because we&#8217;re trying to keep it a little brief and also because we&#8217;ll have a few other podcasts that are specifically about phase three as our explorations get going. Final question here: If you felt like there was one API or one project in particular that could benefit from a lot of community involvement which would you guess that was?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[Héctor Prieto 00:07:20]<br /><br />I don&#8217;t think I can single out any of them. I think getting user feedback is going to be a vital part of this phase, as always. So I would encourage our listeners to just participate in discussions and provide feedback as we start releasing the first prototypes in the Gutenberg plugin. I don&#8217;t think I can pick one of them for you, completely honest.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[Josepha Haden Chomphosy 00:07:43]&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Yeah. My guess for that is going to be the rework of the dashboard, the admin, WP admin. I think that a lot of people are gonna have a lot to say about what they use it for, what they would like to be able to use it for, how to make it look more modern, how to make it feel more modern. I think that that probably is going to benefit from a lot of early testing and possibly some specific user testing around the concepts of design in there.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And so that&#8217;s one that that I think probably is going to take a lot of feedback from the community. And community, in this case, I think, is not only our developers and designers and copy folks who are working to build the CMS, but probably also all of our folks who are extending WordPress, everybody who is working in agencies, things like that.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[Héctor Prieto 00:08:35]<br /><br />Hmm, well, if I need to pick one, I would say the publishing flows could use also lots of feedback and testing because we are going to implement editorial requirements and customized user flows. And, of course, there are many, many different workflows out there that we might not be able to think of ourselves.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So just imagine the sheer amount of different use cases. There&#8217;s going to be, or there currently is with customizations of third-party plugins. So, yeah. I would like to listen to how people would like the publishing flows to be. What are the specific use cases?&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[Josepha Haden Chomphosy 00:09:09]<br /><br />So really, just everything, we need a lot of user feedback on everything.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[Héctor Prieto 00:09:13]<br /><br />Yes. That&#8217;s the summary.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[Josepha Haden Chomphosy 00:09:15]</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I don&#8217;t think that&#8217;s a bad summary. I know that we talk a bit about how WordPress is made better by the activity of our co-creators, the people who are using the software and testing the software, and telling us how it could be better. Those are the groups of people that make sure that we are the best version or headed in the best direction on any of our things with the software.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And so I guess it&#8217;s probably not super unusual for everyone to hear like we need your feedback on everything because that&#8217;s probably what we do half the time.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[Héctor Prieto 00:09:44]<br /><br />Yeah, absolutely.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[Josepha Haden Chomphosy 00:09:47]<br /><br />So the publishing workflows, that reminds me that there has been a little bit of a conversation lately around the naming of this phase, basically.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And I know that the phases don&#8217;t necessarily need names. Like that&#8217;s why they&#8217;re numbered, and that&#8217;s a great idea. Like numbers are wonderful ways to reference things, but it also is just easier to reference it in kind of general conversation.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So the first phase was easier editing, and it really focused on the editing experience itself. The second one was customization, and now the third phase has been called collaboration for quite a bit of time.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But as we got closer and closer to this phase and we had more and more conversations that were coming out of phases one and two, it became really clear that really what we&#8217;re looking at here is more around workflows. And I love that that is an option for how to refer to this. Probably that&#8217;s how I will refer to it for most of the time that I talk about it as we are looking at phase three. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Because I remember that when we were first building the prototypes of Gutenberg, one of the big flags that I had was that breaking changes are not just about what we can see or any sort of visual regressions or what causes the white screen of death. Also, some of the things that are breaking changes should be considered in those workflows when we change where things are or how you accomplish a task.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And our users weren&#8217;t ready for it. That is something that is breaking for them, right?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[Héctor Prieto 00:11:25]&nbsp;<br /><br />Yes. As you mentioned, this phase was referenced as collaboration, real-time collaboration, for a long time, but if we think of how this collaboration looks, it&#8217;s much more than just editing at the same time. A very big part of collaboration is also asynchronous collaboration by adding in-line comments and improving these notifications when you have a comment in your draft. I think the power of this phase is how everything comes together. These individual pieces come together.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[Josepha Haden Chomphosy 0:11:51]<br /><br />Yes, and I don&#8217;t know where that first flag that sparked the discussion around, like, okay, but collaborative editing is not quite big enough and also means a bunch of different things for a bunch of different people. It depends on the size of your organization or the type of content you&#8217;re writing.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Like, I don&#8217;t know where that conversation started. My guess is, you know, some WordCamp somewhere, and an attendee was like, did you, did anybody ever think about these problems? And then they kind of worked their way around the Make Core site or otherwise made their way around to Matias&#8217;s ears.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But yeah, I think that was a really smart choice. And you&#8217;re exactly right, collaborative editing; that can refer to the synchronous kind or the asynchronous kind, and both of those types of collaboration are equally valuable and probably equally used.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[Héctor Prieto 00:12:40]<br /><br />Yes. And one important point to note here is that this editorial flows, and this collaboration is crucial to implement multilingualism going into phase four. We need to think that as soon as we have posts and pages in different languages, there are going to be requirements in terms of how to translate these pieces of content.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So this will need collaboration, all forms of collaboration.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[Josepha Haden Chomphosy 00:13:02]<br /><br />Yeah, absolutely. This maybe was before your time with the project, but I was team multilingual-first for a long time. Or at least thinking that we could do the multilingual part of this work alongside the collaborative editing part of the work. I&#8217;ve spent a lot of time trying to understand what we think is going in phase three versus what probably we need to be able to do as far as having native multilingual support in the project.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And I have softened my very hard position on that. You know, we&#8217;re big fans of strong positions loosely held, strong opinions loosely held. And this was one of those moments where I had that really strong opinion that we could just do them concurrently. We can do them at the same time.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And I think it was a conversation that you and I were having when you were pointing out the complexities of translating WordPress at all, let alone being able to translate all your content as well. And it makes a lot of sense, and you&#8217;re right. I think that there are a lot of interactions, a lot of workflows that we&#8217;re gonna have to kind of refresh or redesign or rebuild before it really makes sense for us to help make that a nice streamlined option for multilingual offerings.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[Héctor Prieto 00:14:17]<br /><br />Yes, absolutely. As a Spanish-speaking person, I&#8217;m super excited about having multilingual in Core, but I also understand that we need some tooling ready before implementing multilingual in Core.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[Josepha Haden Chomphosy 00:14:29]&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>There are no, there really are no easy problems left in WordPress, right? Like, we all agree on this now?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[Héctor Prieto 00:14:36]<br /><br />That&#8217;s correct. And we&#8217;re creating something incrementally. If we look at the phases, they are ordered sequentially. But that doesn&#8217;t mean that when we start phase three, we are, finishing phase two completely in the same way. We have not finished phase one.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>That will be like saying, when is WordPress finished, when is the development finished? So it&#8217;s an incremental project, and it&#8217;s always going to be to need refining. So it&#8217;s of course, multilingual needs to come after collaboration because we need those tools.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But that doesn&#8217;t mean we need to finish the collaboration phase or have it very advanced phase three before we can start phase four. That will be determined in the next month as we start explorations.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[Josepha Haden Chomphosy 00:15:17]&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So if you all, which I know you are, are interested in better workflows, more streamlined ways of working inside WordPress, and or interested in how we are gonna get multilingual settled in the future, this is a great time to get involved in this project and in the community. Like I said, we&#8217;ve got that post up that Matías shipped last week, which, again, if you have not read it, go read it because it&#8217;s got excellent, excellent information in there for you.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Héctor, before we head out, is there anything that you wanna make sure that you let the listeners know, either about phase three or just about WordPress in general?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[Héctor Prieto 00:15:57]<br /><br />Well, tomorrow is WordPress 6.2 release day. So happy 6.2, everybody!</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[Josepha Haden Chomphosy 00:16:04]<br /><br />Happy 6.2. Oh, yeah. Yeah. Which means today is the dry run; probably in three hours, we&#8217;re doing the dry run.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[Héctor Prieto 00:16:14]<br /><br />Depends on when we&#8217;re listening to this, but yes.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[Josepha Haden Chomphosy 00:16:18]&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Oh, that&#8217;s a good point. Right? Not everybody listens to this the second it becomes available. Time zones. That&#8217;s right. Oh, man. Look at us being a global project and just pretending like everybody listens to this particular thing the moment that it&#8217;s available.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I apologize to everybody who&#8217;s listening to it after the release or in the middle of the release party or whatever you&#8217;re doing. Regardless, tomorrow, if you&#8217;re listening to it today, is the WordPress 6.2 release, and it&#8217;s gonna be great.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Well, Héctor, thank you so much for joining me today. I really enjoyed having you on, and thanks for letting me interview you.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[Héctor Prieto 00:16:59]<br /><br />Thank you for having me. It was my pleasure to be here.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[Josepha Haden Chomphosy 00:17:10]</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So that brings us now to our small list of big things, and as is frequently the case, it&#8217;s actually kind of a big list of big things. So we&#8217;re gonna hop right in here. As Héctor and I mentioned in the episode, the release WordPress 6.2 is coming out tomorrow, depending on when you&#8217;re listening to this. If you listen to it on the 27th, it comes out on the 28th of March.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you have a chance to drop by the release party. I would encourage you to; they&#8217;re pretty interesting just to get an idea of everything that it takes to build WordPress. It is, of course, the last few hours before a release, and so you don&#8217;t get a full scope.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But it&#8217;s always nice to see the way that everybody in the community works together, especially there in that last moment when we&#8217;re trying to package something and test it in a bunch of environments all across the world.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[Josepha Haden Chomphosy 00:18:00]&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I love attending those. And so I encourage it. The next episode of the WordPress Briefing is going to have the release rundown.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I&#8217;ll go through the key features and highlights that finally made it into 6.2. The reason we don&#8217;t do those beforehand is just in case we have to remove anything at the last minute from a release. It doesn&#8217;t happen too often, but it does happen sometimes. And so, next episode of WP Briefing, that&#8217;s what we&#8217;ll be talking about.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The next thing on my list is a new developer blog. So there is a brand new developer blog. It was launched last Wednesday. It&#8217;s a great resource for WordPress developers to stay up to date and hear the latest in the WordPress development world. And also, we had been hearing some feedback from our developers in recent years that if you are like exploring how to extend WordPress, if you&#8217;re in that group of extenders, people who are building themes or building plugins, you&#8217;ve kind of feel like you&#8217;ve lost a place where you can have those exploratory conversations.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[Josepha Haden Chomphosy 00:19:00]&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This is gonna be one of those places. We&#8217;ll put a link in the show notes. So far, the content that&#8217;s planned, I think, is really interesting.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Next thing on our small list, big list, of big things is WordCamp Europe&#8217;s Contributor Day.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So registration for Contributor Day is now open, and it does require a separate registration than regular attendance at WordCamp Europe. So if you are registered for WordCamp Europe, you already have your ticket for that, but you are not registered for Contributor Day, click the link in the show notes and come on down to spend a little time giving back to the WordPress Project.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And the last thing on our list today is that we have a WP20 Wapuu coloring giveaway. So put on your little party hats, and grab your crayons. The 20th anniversary Wapuu coloring giveaway is here. There is an opportunity to color in your own community-driven Wapuu and tweet it to us using #WapuuWP20 for your chance to win a sweet haul of WP20 swag items.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[Josepha Haden Chomphosy 00:20:00]</p>\n\n\n\n<p>You can check out the full rules at the link in our show notes.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And that, my friends, is your small list of big things. Thanks for tuning in today for the WordPress Briefing. I&#8217;m your host, Josepha Haden Chomphosy, and I&#8217;ll see you again in a couple of weeks.&nbsp;</p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Mon, 27 Mar 2023 12:00:00 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:14:\"Santana Inniss\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:1;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:109:\"BuddyPress: Let’s celebrate BuddyPress 15th anniversary &amp; welcome the first Attachments Add-on features\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:32:\"https://buddypress.org/?p=328812\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:120:\"https://buddypress.org/2023/03/lets-celebrate-buddypress-15th-anniversary-welcome-the-first-attachments-add-on-features/\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:12818:\"<p>Today is a very special day for the BuddyPress open source project: <strong>15 years</strong> ago, <a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" href=\"https://buddypress.org/members/apeatling/\" target=\"_blank\">Andy</a> pushed the <a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" href=\"https://buddypress.trac.wordpress.org/changeset/1\" target=\"_blank\">first code commit</a> on BP Trac.

The screenshot above shows you an image attached to an activity update: you may say &#8220;OK, great, but it’s a basic feature every social network software include, what’s your point?&#8221;&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Our point is: this long awaited feature is finally available in BuddyPress <img src=\"https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/14.0.0/72x72/1f38a.png\" alt=\"🎊\" class=\"wp-smiley\" />, you simply need to install &amp; activate it from the <a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/bp-attachments/\" target=\"_blank\">WordPress.org plugin directory</a> or directly from your dashboard using the BuddyPress Add-ons tab of the Plugins/Add new WP Admin screen <img src=\"https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/14.0.0/72x72/1f447.png\" alt=\"👇\" class=\"wp-smiley\" />.</p>\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\">\n<a href=\"https://buddypress.org/wp-content/uploads/1/2023/03/bp-15-bp-addons-screen.png\"><img width=\"1024\" height=\"475\" src=\"https://buddypress.org/wp-content/uploads/1/2023/03/bp-15-bp-addons-screen-1024x475.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-328809\" /></a></div>\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-spacer\"></div>\n\n\n\n<p>We’ve been talking about Media in BuddyPress for a long while, we know there are a lot of expectations about it: these are probably the reasons why adding the feature was an intimidating task for the development team. We’ve put ourselves under a lot of pressure to satisfy some of your expectations as a <strong>very humble</strong> start and we thought it could be a nice gift <img src=\"https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/14.0.0/72x72/1f381.png\" alt=\"🎁\" class=\"wp-smiley\" /> to offer the community for our 15th birthday <img src=\"https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/14.0.0/72x72/1f382.png\" alt=\"🎂\" class=\"wp-smiley\" />.</p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-spacer\"></div>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>BP Attachments 1.0.0</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<p>It’s not perfect! (Does anyone reach perfection anyway? <img src=\"https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/14.0.0/72x72/1f642.png\" alt=\"🙂\" class=\"wp-smiley\" /> ) Some of you will probably tell us &#8220;Hey, the plugin is lacking support for this and that, etc&#8230;&#8221;: yes, you’re absolutely right, but let’s remember BuddyPress is free &amp; open source software and keep in mind we, as code contributors, first need a bit of cheers to keep the will to progress. Let me remind you &#8220;free &amp; open source&#8221; is demanding a lot more to users: telling what’s wrong is not enough, you need to contribute to how to fix it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This primary statement made, let’s talk about what’s inside this Attachments BuddyPress Add-on first version.</p>\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\">\n<a href=\"https://buddypress.org/wp-content/uploads/1/2023/03/bp-15-activity-post-form.png\"><img width=\"1024\" height=\"480\" src=\"https://buddypress.org/wp-content/uploads/1/2023/03/bp-15-activity-post-form-1024x480.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-328801\" /></a></div>\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-spacer\"></div>\n\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Attach rich media to your Activity updates</strong></h4>\n\n\n\n<p>Can you see the camera with the music symbol behind in the above screenshot? Great! That’s the button you need to click on to browse your device media and attach one to your activity. Once done you’ll get a small preview of it and information about it. You only want to share a media without any text inside your update? You can do it!</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Media shared inside activities are public</strong>, every member of the community can view it and download it. Of course, you need the Activity component to be active to attach media to its items!</p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-spacer\"></div>\n\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Two<strong> central places to manage your private or public media.</strong></h4>\n\n\n\n<p>BP Attachments comes with a ReactJS UI built thanks to the many WordPress React components available since it uses Blocks. This personal Media Library can be reached from your front-end profile. Once you’ve reached it, you’ll see a Public directory (and a Private one if the site administrator configured it &amp; made it available). Open this directory to be able to share public media, folders, photo albums, music or movie playlists.</p>\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\">\n<a href=\"https://buddypress.org/wp-content/uploads/1/2023/03/bp-15-front-end-personal-media-library.png\"><img width=\"1024\" height=\"731\" src=\"https://buddypress.org/wp-content/uploads/1/2023/03/bp-15-front-end-personal-media-library-1024x731.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-328805\" /></a></div>\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-spacer\"></div>\n\n\n\n<p>That’s the first place where you can add, delete, edit and organize all your media. The second one is located inside the WordPress dashboard. If you have a subscriber or a contributor role, you’ll notice the WordPress Media menu will bring you to your personal Media library.</p>\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\">\n<a href=\"https://buddypress.org/wp-content/uploads/1/2023/03/bp-15-back-end-personal-media-library.png\"><img width=\"1024\" height=\"334\" src=\"https://buddypress.org/wp-content/uploads/1/2023/03/bp-15-back-end-personal-media-library-1024x334.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-328803\" /></a></div>\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-spacer\"></div>\n\n\n\n<p>If you have an author or editor role, your personal media library will be available from a sub menu of the WordPress Media menu. In this place you can do exactly the same thing you are able to do from the front-end interface; it can act as a fallback if the active theme or other plugins are not playing nicely with the Media library page of your front-end profile.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Both locations are only accessible to the Member who created the media (or the Media owner), site administrators also own a front-end Media library, but in the WordPress dashboard, they get something more powerful: a <strong>moderating</strong> tool.</p>\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\">\n<a href=\"https://buddypress.org/wp-content/uploads/1/2023/03/bp-15-back-end-personal-media-libraries.png\"><img width=\"1024\" height=\"287\" src=\"https://buddypress.org/wp-content/uploads/1/2023/03/bp-15-back-end-personal-media-libraries-1024x287.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-328802\" /></a></div>\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-spacer\"></div>\n\n\n\n<p>As you can see, the site administrator can access the Media Library belonging to <a href=\"https://buddypress.org/members/dcavins/\">@dcavins</a> or <a href=\"https://buddypress.org/members/imath/\">@imath</a> to remove some &#8220;spammy&#8221; media if necessary. Using the &#8220;My Media&#8221; directory drives the administrator to his or her personal Media library.</p>\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\">\n<a href=\"https://buddypress.org/wp-content/uploads/1/2023/03/bp-15-attachments-settings-scaled.jpg\"><img width=\"1024\" height=\"583\" src=\"https://buddypress.org/wp-content/uploads/1/2023/03/bp-15-attachments-settings-1024x583.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-328810\" /></a></div>\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-spacer\"></div>\n\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Attach rich media to your private conversations</strong></h4>\n\n\n\n<p>If the Messages component is active &amp; Private media is allowed by the administrator from the BuddyPress options screen as shown above, then community members can share media within their private conversations. Unlike Activity Attachments, Messages Attachments <strong>are always private</strong> and can only be viewed or downloaded by the Media owner and the private conversation participants.</p>\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\">\n<a href=\"https://buddypress.org/wp-content/uploads/1/2023/03/bp-15-messages-attachment.png\"><img width=\"1024\" height=\"747\" src=\"https://buddypress.org/wp-content/uploads/1/2023/03/bp-15-messages-attachment-1024x747.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-328811\" /></a></div>\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-spacer\"></div>\n\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Community Media directory</strong></h4>\n\n\n\n<p>All public media can be browsed from the Community Media directory. Depending on the allowed media types the administrator chose, this directory can contain one or more navigation items to filter the displayed layout : one for all media, one for images, one for movies, one for sounds and  one for all other file types.</p>\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\">\n<a href=\"https://buddypress.org/wp-content/uploads/1/2023/03/bp-15-community-media-directory.jpg\"><img width=\"1024\" height=\"590\" src=\"https://buddypress.org/wp-content/uploads/1/2023/03/bp-15-community-media-directory-1024x590.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-328804\" /></a></div>\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-spacer\"></div>\n\n\n\n<p>When you click on one of the displayed media items, you reach its single view where you can download it, and where you’ll be able to comment, like, share etc.. in future releases of the BuddyPress Add-on.</p>\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\">\n<a href=\"https://buddypress.org/wp-content/uploads/1/2023/03/bp-15-single-media.jpg\"><img width=\"1024\" height=\"878\" src=\"https://buddypress.org/wp-content/uploads/1/2023/03/bp-15-single-media-1024x878.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-328806\" /></a></div>\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-spacer\"></div>\n\n\n\n<p>PS: you can already share an embedded version of the media copying &amp; pasting its link into a WordPress embed block.</p>\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\">\n<a href=\"https://buddypress.org/wp-content/uploads/1/2023/03/bp-15-wp-editor-upload-bp-attachments.png\"><img width=\"1024\" height=\"492\" src=\"https://buddypress.org/wp-content/uploads/1/2023/03/bp-15-wp-editor-upload-bp-attachments-1024x492.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-328807\" /></a></div>\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-spacer\"></div>\n\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Attach rich media to WordPress posts</strong></h4>\n\n\n\n<p>Finally, the BP Attachments Add-on comes with image, video, sound and file blocks.

He identified seven areas: </p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Real-time collaboration</strong> &#8211; more than one person can edit a post at the same time.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Asynchronous collaboration.</strong> Writers and editors share drafts and discuss via a comments assignments, topics etc. This part is all about workflow among a team of editors. </li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Publishing flows.</strong> Publishing checklists, managing requirements and allowing for customization as every site has different needs. </li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Post revisions interface.</strong> A way to coordinate updates and add new content in a scheduled manner.  There will be overlap with Theme switching and applying styles, for instance for Christmas, or other occasions. </li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Admin design.</strong> Ventura wrote about this last year in <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/design/2022/06/13/thinking-through-the-wordpress-admin-experience/\">Thinking Through the WordPress Admin Experience</a>. Notifications, list views updated UI to include new features. </li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Library</strong> &#8211; A space where users manage Patterns, Blocks, Styles, and Fonts. </li>\n\n\n\n<li>Develop a <strong>global search &amp; command component</strong></li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p>I just briefly touched on the seven areas, and might not do it full justice. Ventura provided in his post many more details. <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/2023/03/24/phase-3-collaboration/\">It&#8217;s worth a read</a>.  Give it time to digest, too.

Diego launched the pro version in 2021 to help support his efforts developing the free plugin but said this is no longer necessary.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;Originally I had planned on developing a plugin business,&#8221; he said. &#8220;But I found my love for building, contributing, and educating surpassed my desire to be an entrepreneur in the plugin space. This way, I can focus on my passion and also support the community.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Version 3.0.0 includes previously pro features such as <a href=\"https://blockvisibilitywp.com/knowledge-base/how-to-use-the-browser-device-control/\">browser and device control</a> that allows for displaying custom content based on the browser and/or device of the current user. It also adds <a href=\"https://blockvisibilitywp.com/knowledge-base/how-to-use-the-location-control/\">Location control</a>, which isn&#8217;t what it sounds like. It allows users to show or hide content based on where the block is located on the website and attributes of its location. Blocks can be conditionally displayed based on post taxonomy, post type, and other rules that offer more control over block visibility than one might ever have imagined possible.</p>\n\n\n\n<img />Block Visibility documentation on <a href=\"https://blockvisibilitywp.com/knowledge-base/how-to-use-the-browser-device-control/\">Browser and Device Control</a>\n\n\n\n<p>This update brings in controls for <a href=\"https://blockvisibilitywp.com/knowledge-base/how-to-use-the-cookie-control/\">Cookies</a>, <a href=\"https://blockvisibilitywp.com/knowledge-base/how-to-use-the-metadata-control/\">Metadata</a>, <a href=\"https://blockvisibilitywp.com/knowledge-base/how-to-use-the-referral-source-control/\">Referral Source</a>, and <a href=\"https://blockvisibilitywp.com/knowledge-base/how-to-use-the-url-path-control/\">URL Path</a>. It expands the <a href=\"https://blockvisibilitywp.com/knowledge-base/how-to-use-the-date-time-control/\">Date &amp; Time</a> control to include Day of Week and Time of Day. </p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://blockvisibilitywp.com/knowledge-base/guide-to-visibility-presets/\">Visibility Presets</a> is another mind-blowing new feature in this release, the kind that makes you wonder how this could be a free plugin. It allows users to create a collection of visibility conditions that can be applied to other blocks with a single click. Blocks can have multiple presets applied, and Diego said this is just the first iteration of this feature. </p>\n\n\n\n<img />Block Visibility documentation on <a href=\"https://blockvisibilitywp.com/knowledge-base/guide-to-visibility-presets/\">Visibility Presets</a>\n\n\n\n<p>This release includes everything except the WooCommerce and Easy Digital Downloads controls, which include conditional block logic for shopping cart contents, product details, customer metrics, and more. Diego plans to add those later in April with the next version (3.1.0), so he can make a few further changes to them before including them in the free version. Users who rely on the WooCommerce or Easy Digital Downloads controls will need to wait until the next release to deactivate the Pro add-on.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Block Visibility plugin&#8217;s <a href=\"https://blockvisibilitywp.com/knowledge-base/\">documentation</a> is already extensive, with videos, screenshots, and tutorials for nearly every feature. Diego said he will be investing more time into documenting how developers can create their own <a href=\"https://github.com/ndiego/block-visibility-add-on-example\">Block Visibility extensions</a>. The plugin currently has more than 9,000 active users and will likely see more growth now that the pro features are getting rolled into the free version. </p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Sat, 25 Mar 2023 02:31:54 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"Sarah Gooding\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:4;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:63:\"Post Status: Launching a WordPress Product in Public: Session 6\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:32:\"https://poststatus.com/?p=148481\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:73:\"https://poststatus.com/launching-a-wordpress-product-in-public-session-6/\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:39309:\"<div class=\"is-layout-flow wp-block-group eplus-wrapper has-theme-palette-2-color has-theme-palette-8-background-color has-text-color has-background\"><div class=\"wp-block-group__inner-container\"><div class=\"wp-block-post-excerpt\"><p class=\"wp-block-post-excerpt__excerpt\">Transcript ↓ Learn from Corey Maass, a master of WordPress plugins and apps, and Cory Miller, a marketing, business, and WordPress experience guru.

The two discuss the intimacies of partnering on a product and how solopreneurs can benefit from support.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Top Takeaways:</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li><strong>The Value of Partnerships.</strong> Starting a business can be a lonely experience. Having someone to bounce ideas off, talk through tough subjects with, and celebrate successes with makes a significant difference. Having that collaborative support system can make managing a business more enjoyable and streamlined, which is a huge benefit, especially for startups and small businesses.&nbsp;</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Discussion vs. Decision. </strong>It’s important to be intentional with communication considering the stage you are in when you are improving a product or creating something brand new. Being vocal about whether you are still discussing or whether you are ready to make decisive moves is critical to keep the process moving forward without missteps.&nbsp;</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>The Art of Failing.</strong> Understanding that taking risks and being willing to fail in order to ultimately achieve success is key for solopreneurs and partnerships. Quantifying your success rate on projects isn’t the ultimate indicator of how successful you truly are. Stumbling through a myriad of shortcomings while still pursuing success is powerful.</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\">\n\n</div>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"eplus-wrapper\" id=\"h-mentioned-in-the-show\"><img src=\"https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/14.0.0/72x72/1f517.png\" alt=\"🔗\" class=\"wp-smiley\" /> Mentioned in the show:</h3>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://crop.express/\">Crop.Express</a></li>\n\n\n\n<li><a href=\"https://elementor.com/\">Elementor</a></li>\n\n\n\n<li><a href=\"https://www.wpbeaverbuilder.com/?mm_campaign=brand&gclid=Cj0KCQjwtsCgBhDEARIsAE7RYh23X1L149jQi21SES3Z61y0aaY770GDRGkCSimg-hDgjtWb6JfA0xEaAqzDEALw_wcB\">Beaver Builder</a></li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"eplus-wrapper\" id=\"h-you-can-follow-post-status-and-our-guests-on-twitter\"><img src=\"https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/14.0.0/72x72/1f426.png\" alt=\"🐦\" class=\"wp-smiley\" /> You can follow Post Status and our guests on Twitter:</h3>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"eplus-wrapper\">\n<li><a href=\"http://twitter.com/coreymaass\">Corey Maass</a></li>\n\n\n\n<li><a href=\"https://twitter.com/corymiller303\">Cory Miller</a> (CEO, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/post_status\">Post Status</a>)</li>\n\n\n\n<li><a href=\"https://twitter.com/lemonadecode\">Olivia Bisset</a> (Intern, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/post_status\">Post Status</a>)</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"eplus-wrapper has-background\">The <strong>Post Status Draft</strong> podcast is geared toward WordPress professionals, with interviews, news, and deep analysis. <img src=\"https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/14.0.0/72x72/1f4dd.png\" alt=\"📝\" class=\"wp-smiley\" /><br /><br /><a href=\"https://poststatus.com/category/post-status-podcasts/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Browse our archives</a>, and don’t forget to subscribe via <a href=\"https://itunes.apple.com/us/podcast/post-status-draft-wordpress/id976403008\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">iTunes</a>, <a href=\"https://podcasts.google.com/feed/aHR0cHM6Ly9mZWVkcy5zaW1wbGVjYXN0LmNvbS8ySkU5c2M4UA\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Google Podcasts</a>, <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/c/PostStatus\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">YouTube</a>, <a href=\"http://www.stitcher.com/podcast/krogsgard/post-status-draft-wordpress-podcast\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Stitcher</a>, <a href=\"https://wordpress-post-status-draft-podcast.simplecast.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Simplecast</a>, or <a href=\"https://feeds.simplecast.com/2JE9sc8P\">RSS</a>. <img src=\"https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/14.0.0/72x72/1f3a7.png\" alt=\"🎧\" class=\"wp-smiley\" /></p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"eplus-wrapper\" id=\"h-transcript\">Transcript</h2>\n\n\n\n<h2>Session 6 Corey &amp; Cory Launch a WordPress Product Live</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Cory Miller: [00:00:00] Ooh, cheers are good. . You talented, man.<br />Corey Maass: So yeah, session six. Okay. Impromptu time change, but life happens. And that&#8217;s part of the<br />journey of being a founder. Exactly.<br />Cory Miller: Let me push it to Twitter.<br />Corey Maass: Are we founders? Yeah.<br />Entrepreneurs, founders Starters,<br />for once. I&#8217;m not a solopreneur,<br />Cory Miller: you know, I talked to a lot of people over the years and, um, Like solopreneurs. And the one thing I<br />hear from a lot of &#8217;em, cause I had, I had partners from the beginning, they weren&#8217;t active. But is that, you know,<br />business as lonely as it is and um, [00:01:00] having somebody else to kind of walk with I think is pretty dang<br />awesome.<br />Yeah,<br />Corey Maass: I, I did it best when I worked in a co-working space with, Four other guys that I was friends with and<br />we had formed a little cohort and so regularly, you know, get out of, get out of the house, get to a, a focused place<br />of work. And then have people who you were on a journey with and knew their journey.<br />And so you could grab somebody and say, Hey, can we talk this through for a minute? And that went in all<br />directions. Like it just makes such a difference. Yeah,<br />Cory Miller: it, it really does. Um, I had Matt Daner and I themes, um, On the team. And of course my Lindsay<br />was, um, in and around the team in different ways. Um, and it was just then I have my business group, which I told<br />you I&#8217;m meeting with this afternoon, [00:02:00] I&#8217;ve walked with for 11 years, and I tell you, wow, it&#8217;s such a tough<br />job.<br />You know, where you&#8217;re trying to, like we&#8217;re doing here. Where if it wasn&#8217;t with you, I&#8217;d be sitting here going, okay,<br />what segments are we gonna try to hit? You know, and. And the highs and lows. You know, there&#8217;s things that you<br />celebrate as an entrepreneur that you not, maybe not necessarily celebrate with your team.<br />And just having another group, or a sidekick or a partner or whatever that is, I think is pretty dang healthy for me<br />Corey Maass: at least. Yeah. And yeah, it&#8217;s, it&#8217;s a step better than rubber ducking it also, I find, Because it&#8217;s like,<br />you know, I don&#8217;t, I don&#8217;t always immediately respond to you, and you don&#8217;t always immediately respond to me.<br />But I have a, a real human being to say things at, even if it&#8217;s not to talk about it with, and, you know, when you see<br />the message in the afternoon and, and [00:03:00] celebrate it with me, that I fixed a bug or whatever it is like that.<br />Makes a difference and you ping me out of, you know, whenever you kind of, whenever you need to.<br />Like, that&#8217;s such a difference cuz like, who did I, oh, for a different product. I was having issues with, not issues at<br />all with, um, EDD I was trying to hack the hell out of EDD , let&#8217;s be honest. Um, to make it do things that it has no<br />right doing. Because it&#8217;s the better product. I&#8217;d rather use the core and slap my janky ass code on top of it.<br />Anyway, there&#8217;s my little EDDendorsement. Um, but I know one of the head programmers over there and was like,<br />I would love to have him look at this. And he and I were in a. Co-working group years ago. And so I have a little bit<br />of connection with him, you know, but haven&#8217;t talked to him in a year or two.<br />And so I had to hesitate and I hemmed and hod and was like, let me, let me refactor this five [00:04:00] times<br />before I send it over to him because I don&#8217;t wanna waste his time. I&#8217;m using up a favor. I guess that&#8217;s my long way<br />of saying that I&#8217;m using up a favor. And uh, and if you have somebody. You&#8217;ve lost count of favors or you have a<br />partner, then you don&#8217;t have to hesitate.<br />And honestly, that, that lack of hesitation is huge. I hadn&#8217;t really thought about it like that, but it&#8217;s just that what a<br />waste of time. I mean, it was great that it made me refactor my code because, you know, that&#8217;s never a bad thing.<br />But, uh, have to think that hard about just asking a question rather than just asking a question.<br />Maybe that&#8217;s why we all like chat, GPT or something.<br />Cory Miller: Yeah. You&#8217;re not alone, . No, I, I think that&#8217;s, uh, when I left eye themes, I wanted to do coaching and<br />had some clients my first year before I started with post status and, um, I said, you know, the hardest for me was<br />when I was [00:05:00] in trying to make these big decisions and, and even the little ones, and just having<br />someone.<br />I could bounce things off of. So that, that&#8217;s one of the reasons I did coaching. One of the reasons I talked about my<br />group as much like I left, came back, they were gracious enough to, to let me come back. And, um, these were the<br />several of the guys that were in Phoenix with me and, um, In fact, that&#8217;s who&#8217;s funeral, uh, dad&#8217;s funeral.<br />One of the guys that went with us is where I&#8217;m going today. Mm. Uh, while we couldn&#8217;t meet at a normal time, but,<br />you know, just kind of doing life together, but then having someone just to bounce stuff off of, like, I feel like you&#8217;re<br />very open and we&#8217;re having this conversation where it&#8217;s, it feels like, you know, the whole improv plus one, it&#8217;s like<br />we&#8217;re keeping, we&#8217;re, I think we&#8217;re trying to keep each other kind of.<br />on the trail here, but you know, you&#8217;d let me veer off and like discuss it. Let&#8217;s take a sidebar side trail. Yeah.<br />[00:06:00] And come back, . And that&#8217;s part of my process though, and I really deeply respect that and appreciate<br />it for you. Um, but just having somebody that understands that you can bounce stuff off, it&#8217;s pretty, pretty critical.<br />Corey Maass: Yeah. Well, I, I&#8217;m a big proponent of, uh, discussion, not decision, which I. Once I learned that I, I&#8217;m<br />a, I&#8217;m a big rule person, so like I applied that rule to most conversations and try to make sure that it&#8217;s clear to<br />everybody else. Um, but also I think more often it&#8217;s the. Being vocal about when you&#8217;re switching to decision.<br />So it&#8217;s like, okay, you know, we are still discussing, we are still discussing. Now we are deciding because as you&#8217;ve<br />seen, I&#8217;m prone to go, oh, that sounded cool, and then I just go off and, and do it rather than, you know, is that the<br />best use of my time, is at the highest priority, all [00:07:00] those kinds of things.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So try to impose that upon myself a lot of the time too of like, is. You know, because I&#8217;m also, I&#8217;m the type of<br />extrovert who needs to talk out loud. And so there tends to be a lot of discussion. Um, you know, oh, hold on, I got<br />a barking dog. Come on.<br />Cory Miller: I think that&#8217;s good, especially in the beginning, in the start, you know, um, is making, you know, the<br />whole woodworking thing is measured twice, cut once kind of thing. Not to say to get into overthinking or<br />overanalyzing, but we&#8217;re, we&#8217;re figuring it out, you know? Right. Uh, together. And I think that&#8217;s been pretty critical<br />and really, like last week was huge breakthrough for me.<br />It&#8217;s. Seeing, okay, here&#8217;s v1, or here&#8217;s the free version, I should say, what we&#8217;re gonna do there, and then there&#8217;s<br />all this, we can kind of chase and see what&#8217;s there for [00:08:00] the pro side.<br />Corey Maass: Yep. Yep. One more, one more comment on partnerships too is I think I&#8217;ve talked about like I&#8217;ve,<br />I&#8217;ve looked for people to work with for years and one of those.<br />one of the outstanding questions is always that I&#8217;ve, that I&#8217;ve heard from other people that I&#8217;ve worried about too, is<br />the, like, how do you, how do you quantify compatibility? Right? And it&#8217;s like, I couldn&#8217;t, I think I&#8217;m, I&#8217;m bringing this<br />up rhetorically, like, it&#8217;s not a question necessarily unless you have something, unless you have an answer.<br />But it&#8217;s like, You, you and I sort of talked about it a little bit and then said, okay, let&#8217;s work on this together, and I<br />didn&#8217;t hesitate and, and of course then I&#8217;m like, you know, then we have amazing con like we&#8217;ve had amazing<br />conversations. . And I think that it helps that we both have [00:09:00] been aware of each other for a while and so<br />have some sense of how we operate.<br />And I think I&#8217;ve also, I&#8217;ve heard you speak in public, you&#8217;ve heard me speak in public, so I, I had a sense of you,<br />and I&#8217;m being presumptuous, but I imagine you had some sense of me. Um, but it&#8217;s, it&#8217;s definitely one of those,<br />What does this look like in a year? And if we end up with, you know, an I themes or a, you know, something,<br />something, Of of decent size.<br />You know how, how do you know that that person that you casually said, oh yeah, we should work on this little<br />plugin together with ends up being the person that you partner with. And that&#8217;s, it&#8217;s crazy cuz there&#8217;s so much<br />around pairing people and, you know, meeting co-founders and stuff like that, and, Yeah, I don&#8217;t know.<br />It&#8217;s ju it&#8217;s like I say, I think I&#8217;m bringing it up rhetorically from my perspective. It&#8217;s just, it&#8217;s a crapshoot. You just kind<br />of go with your gut .<br />Cory Miller: [00:10:00] Yeah, I, I totally agree. Um, you know, I, I&#8217;m trying to think how many times I&#8217;ve partnered<br />and it&#8217;s been quite a few, you know, uh, Brian, initially with post status, I had two partners.<br />They weren&#8217;t, weren&#8217;t active in the business. Um, at Ithe, I&#8217;ve had several. Um, partnerships last four years. Um,<br />and, uh, I, I almost think it&#8217;s like this product stuff, partner, partnerships and products are very similar in my<br />experience for me is that . I told Lindsay, I said, you know, when we started Ithe, it&#8217;s like people bought it and they<br />kept buying it and it was pretty, pretty simple, like a good looking theme.<br />You know, and this is 2008, and I did these things and put &#8217;em out there and things that I kind of wanted for myself,<br />but I didn&#8217;t think, like, I didn&#8217;t have a big inner monologue of like, should I do dropdown menu? Should I not?<br />Should I do? [00:11:00] I was just doing things I wanted to do, which spoke to like, I was obviously embedded in<br />our user group that were customers that eventually bought to us.<br />And I think that was first. But like I say, I compare it to baseball, like products and maybe even partnership and<br />people, it&#8217;s like, you know, classic growing up was Tony Gwen, San Diego Padres. He got on base all the time. If<br />you hit 300 in the majors, you&#8217;re, you&#8217;re in the Hall of Fame. If you have a career consistently with 300 in, you&#8217;re,<br />you&#8217;re in the Hall of Fame, even close to it, you&#8217;re probably in the Hall of Fame.<br />And, uh, when I left Ithe and tried to start some new projects, products, and businesses and partnerships, I was<br />like, oh yeah, I just know, I know how to do this, I can do this. And I was like, oh, you know, that means Tony struck<br />out three out of 10 means Tony struck out or got out seven times out of 10, but he&#8217;s in the Hall of Fame.<br />And I&#8217;m like, wow. That&#8217;s kind of like [00:12:00] entrepreneurship and products. And, and I&#8217;m gonna go even<br />further, uh, uh, partnerships, you know, like it&#8217;s, it&#8217;s not a high percentage of wins in my personal experience. , um,<br />from products like, I don&#8217;t know if you, if I told you this, we had 200 s skews that I think were not left 200 plus.<br />How many of those actually made money? Right? Like maybe it&#8217;s, that&#8217;s a little bit low, but like, you know, and uh,<br />then I&#8217;ve gotten crushed cuz things just don&#8217;t go as fast or as easy as I always want them to. And you&#8217;ve done a<br />number of products and I don&#8217;t know where you&#8217;re, you staying with partnerships, but, Just a lot of failure, a lot of<br />learn learning lessons.<br />Corey Maass: I, I learned, I was in New York, uh, I had just moved to New York after college and there was one<br />couple, so I was pursuing mo a music career, mostly, um, DJing, producing dance music, electronic music. And<br />there was one [00:13:00] married couple who threw a party and had started a label and. They were, uh, they were<br />bananas.<br />They were all over the place. They were, they&#8217;re still very eccentric people. I, I love them to death, but they are, uh,<br />sometimes out there. But I would follow them anywhere. And I, and I finally quantified it and I was like, because<br />they. 7% of what they say they&#8217;re gonna do. Everybody in New York City talks a great game.<br />Every bartender is a comedian. You know, every person you meet, working any kind of job is actually writing a<br />script or is in a band or whatever, which is awesome. But most people talk a really good game and don&#8217;t actually<br />do. What they say they&#8217;re gonna do. And so I think that for me, a lot of it is, is exactly what you talked about.<br />Like people don&#8217;t have to have success. Like I didn&#8217;t wanna work with you be necessarily because you had<br />success, [00:14:00] but because you&#8217;ve put yourself out there, you&#8217;ve clearly done a lot, you&#8217;ve tried a lot, and you<br />keep trying. And I think that that, like for me, that&#8217;s the gold standard. Like I try to live by that.<br />Like I put, I put a lot of products out there. Same thing have, how many of my products have actually like done<br />anything made little blips, you know? But you&#8217;ve gotta keep getting up to bat. I think this is the first baseball</p>\n\n\n\n<p>analogy I&#8217;ve ever made in my life. But you&#8217;ve gotta keep getting up to bat and eventually you&#8217;re gonna hit<br />something, presumably, you know, big or small.<br />And then you want to keep, you know, practice makes perfect kind.<br />Cory Miller: I tell you, the part of like, keep going on is the one I&#8217;ve really struggled with the last four years. Hmm.<br />Just keep going on. Um, and then last year with the burnout, um, and all that kind of stuff is just like, it&#8217;s, it&#8217;s tough<br />because, uh, it&#8217;s, it&#8217;s one thing if like this, nothing huge, significant, but not like life shattering.<br />Is dependent on [00:15:00] this. Um, but you know, when I left Ithe, I didn&#8217;t really have another business to just<br />kind of walk onto. Now Posttest came next, you know, the next year, and it wa and it was like really good timing for<br />me. Um, but now it&#8217;s, you know, it&#8217;s still a part-time gig for me. So like, It, it&#8217;s been tough cuz you just kind of have<br />these ideas to put &#8217;em out there.<br />And the theme I told people for how I&#8217;ve done business, at least my ithe chapter, is stumbling successfully. Like ,<br />keeping going, tripping but not falling flat on your face. You know, like, just kind of keep a low profile to the ground.<br />Cause you&#8217;re gonna keep stumbling. And, and you know, a lot of the products, for instance, were stumbled like,<br />and I&#8217;m not, I&#8217;m not saying it&#8217;s pure.<br />However, there was healthy blend of right time or a place, um, hard work, right. To get more luck. And then once<br />the first one was rolling, it was easier to add [00:16:00] new, you know, when you get that first hit, it&#8217;s easier to hit<br />to do others. But I still didn&#8217;t have even a like 50% success rate , you know?<br />Corey Maass: Yep. Well look at Google.<br />How many products have they shut down, you know? Yeah. So anyway, sorry. I wanna respect your time. So<br />we&#8217;ve got 10 minutes. I&#8217;ve, I&#8217;ve dragged this out much longer than I needed to. I did too. Um, um, so product, we<br />have version 0 0 2 is in the repo. Uh, the has come a long way. Uh, we have added, uh, a few bells and whistles.<br />I&#8217;ve cleaned up the UI a bit, and then a duplicate. Cropper is now in the media library. So if you go to media library,<br />there&#8217;s now an extra button that says Upload and Crop. Next to add new. I felt a little bad totally ripping out the<br />ADD new button, but we can decide to do that because there is now a [00:17:00] bypass.<br />So you, even if you open the cropper, And select an image. There&#8217;s a button that says, crop it. There&#8217;s a button<br />that says Just upload it so you can bypass the crop. Um, and then the other sort of sneaky thing that I, I added last<br />minute yesterday is if you go to media, add new, it technically opens the media library with the cropper open.<br />So we are totally hijacking media a new, so I mean, all these. Discussions, not decisions, but at this point we&#8217;ve<br />still got fewer than 10 users. And you and I are, are kind of, you know, we are a kitten with a ball. We&#8217;re bating it<br />around just kind of deciding, you know, where we wanna land with it.<br />Cory Miller: Um, it&#8217;s great. The new stuff that you pushed out, I think that&#8217;s awesome. Iterating on some things<br />that you feel like, hey, I, this is a small little check I can do that I think is so good for progress on the product.<br />[00:18:00] So I was looking at it on my personal site and then my test site and um, I&#8217;ll give you, I&#8217;ll give you notes,<br />uh, in chat too.<br />But when I tried to upload from the media library and I just installed the new plugin on my personal, lemme do this<br />real quick. It&#8217;s not showing the preview. Sorry. I should just be showing you.<br />It&#8217;s not showing that preview. And maybe I&#8217;ve got the wrong image or something like that, but, oh, huh. So we got<br />uploading crop<br />so it&#8217;s not preview in here, and then I just click square crop. Huh. So I don&#8217;t, I I, I&#8217;ve done it at least on two sites<br />and it&#8217;s done this, so I wanted to mention it. Ooh. But lemme just say, Thank you for that button iterating on those<br />buttons, these two, because I was testing your previous version [00:19:00] and with my, with images from my<br />phone, and one was like sideways and I was like, Hey, so oh yeah, you got that in like, I don&#8217;t<br />know, an hour after we test.<br />Corey Maass: Well, I, yeah, the, I mean this is, we are still riding the, the happiness that is the library we&#8217;re using.<br />Um, so there&#8217;s, there&#8217;s, they. Rotate. They also have, um, you can actually flip it horizontally and vertically, which is<br />an option, but I don&#8217;t think we need it. Um, I don&#8217;t, I don&#8217;t yet see the use case. Um, but rotate, I was like, I will add<br />it.<br />He must be onto something. And the fact that you pulled it from your phone and we&#8217;re like, oh, instead of rotating it<br />on my phone and then uploading it again, make creative tasks simpler, easier, fun. There you go. Like, you<br />shouldn&#8217;t have to think like, oh, I have to rotate it in one place before I upload it to another.<br />Um, but I will go fix that bug. So, um, the, to me, the outstanding [00:20:00] question is, um, we, I think we did<br />come to the conclusion last week that we want a settings page, which let. The creator of the site or the whoever is<br />controlling the site, which might be the same person who&#8217;s creating content, but to go into a settings page and say,<br />four featured images, we want 16, nine, and we want them to be 1600 pixels wide every single time.<br />Set it once, forget it, and then they go set their featured image right. When we are including that. Originally we&#8217;d<br />said that that was be, that would be a paid thing, but I. I kind of feel like the free version&#8217;s useless without it.<br />Cory Miller: Yeah, I do too. And I think we&#8217;re gonna get more momentum, um, with this, with that thing cuz we, like<br />we talked last week, really becomes a cool utility tool for a, a problem.<br />And so<br />Corey Maass: and, and is and is feature complete? Is product complete? [00:21:00] Yep.<br />Cory Miller: Yeah. So the savings page with the custom. Dimensions. That&#8217;s really our biggest thing left, is that<br />right?<br />Corey Maass: Uh, and, and we want to, there&#8217;s all the other holes, all the other places where you upload an<br />image. So to me, um, after media library, I think block is the next big one.<br />So I think we, I think we need, cuz I, I use the classic editor and I&#8217;m gonna look at. Adding our cropper to featured<br />image. You know, and, and classic editor plugin has, you know, millions of installs. So I, it&#8217;s, it there. I don&#8217;t think<br />there&#8217;s, to me, there&#8217;s not a clear majority one way or the other. Gutenberg block editor over classic editor.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We need, we need the cropper in both. Um, but since we have [00:22:00] the beginning of the block, I think that<br />that&#8217;s, um, the way to go. And I, I, at some point I will look. Also applying it to the classic editor. Okay. But it&#8217;s, it&#8217;s<br />finding all of those primary places and there&#8217;s a lo as we&#8217;ve talked about, there&#8217;s a long, long tail.<br />Like eventually we will build a module for Elementor and, and Beaver Builder. Um, but we need to work, work for<br />vanilla WordPress first. Yeah.<br />Cory Miller: So that leaves me at really, and I&#8217;m with this with process too, is like, we need a lot, it seems like we<br />need a lot of users. Mm-hmm. to start getting more users in there, giving feedback, requesting features.<br />And this next one with the, uh, well the blocks will be big, but that&#8217;s another conversation. But like, I think the<br />custom dimensions, then we&#8217;re getting [00:23:00] something. I ped and ccd you in those. As you know, Robbie<br />from Beaver Builder, Kathy San from Cadence. Um, I need to look at generate press. Um, but then we bumped up<br />against like everybody be gone, being gone for Asia or Camp Asia.<br />Um, but yeah, are you going to any word camps? I&#8217;ll have it down for like a placeholder for Europe and then US is<br />standard for me for sure. You are gonna go, yeah, I was supposed to go to Phoenix, but yeah. What, what about<br />you? Do you have any plans.<br />Corey Maass: I was, uh, thinking about US . So if you&#8217;re gonna be there, then yeah, we need to meet up.<br />That&#8217;s in August, so. Okay. It gives us, um, let&#8217;s do plenty of time to, I think that&#8217;d be a blast. Yeah. We could do<br />this live. That&#8217;d be fun. Do it live.<br />Cory Miller: Let&#8217;s, uh, let&#8217;s plan. Yeah, let&#8217;s plan on that. I&#8217;d be, that&#8217;d be great if another opportunity comes up in<br />between. Um, I know work camps are getting started and [00:24:00] stuff, or, um, we&#8217;ve loosely been throwing<br />around some in-person stuff with.<br />Post, but I&#8217;ll let you know, uh, before we even announce that and see if you&#8217;re able to, to get to it too. Um, nothing,<br />sorry.<br />Corey Maass: Yeah. Um, I derailed us. So you were talking about getting users. Um, do we, to me, I&#8217;m starting<br />more and more, I&#8217;m getting anxious that we don&#8217;t have a website. Okay. Which, I mean, we.<br />crop.express the website that is currently just the cropper, um, but to, with no mention of the plugin. And so I&#8217;d love<br />for you to start thinking about what that looks like,<br />even if it&#8217;s a little banner that then links to a landing. You know, we could have crop.express/wordpress plugin and<br />have a landing page temporarily, but [00:25:00] just cuz it&#8217;s even like I&#8217;m now. I&#8217;m linking people to the plugin in the<br />repo, but I feel like we wanna start expanding the use case, expanding what we&#8217;re talking about, you know, to a<br />website.<br />Cory Miller: Um, yes, absolutely. I think we&#8217;re there<br />Corey Maass: in the coming weeks. It doesn&#8217;t need to be tomorrow. Yeah,<br />Cory Miller: I was thinking about. Um, from the brand we talked about last week too. Mm-hmm. , it&#8217;s like, do we<br />just go ahead and make the keep, keep crop.express like it is? Hmm. Probably link to it, but then at some point<br />we&#8217;ll probably want to change an update plugin to go what our new brand is.<br />And that made me think about, my mind went to. Some discussion that could be recorded like this for users, not<br />about our product [00:26:00] necessarily, or this detailed stuff, but you know, hey, here&#8217;s some sources we can,<br />where you can go find all, you know, all these images. Um, some of those mar more messaging, marketing<br />content, thoughts we had last week.<br />I was like, you know, that might be, um, pretty good. It&#8217;s like having that site. Maybe scheduling, you know, some,<br />like, we outline it loosely and just talk through and then we can take that, you know, put it on our YouTube channel,<br />all that kinda stuff. And then, um, maybe see if we turn that into like our lead magnet or something like that to start<br />building emails.<br />That&#8217;s where my head goes initially, but I&#8217;ve. We&#8217;ve got two things on my list, outreach and website. Um, right now,<br />at least until you tell me otherwise. Um,<br />Corey Maass: well, and, and the other thing that Kathy brought up that I thought was valuable was to aid in your<br />discussions. [00:27:00] She&#8217;s like, oh, what does it do? And we&#8217;re, and you were like, here&#8217;s the plugin.<br />And she&#8217;s like, Oh, thanks. Now I have to go find a WordPress install, install it on this WordPress install. And then<br />because it&#8217;s essentially a a beta, we have no guidance. We have no user docs, we have no anything. And so she&#8217;s<br />like s Now if she even gets that far, she&#8217;s like splashing around trying to figure out what the hell it does and how<br />so?<br />Um, I kind of feel like we are getting close to, like, I could do a. QuickTime, screen capture of here&#8217;s how you re<br />crop your featured image. 1, 2, 3. Mm-hmm. , here&#8217;s how you crop an image going into media library, you know,<br />and put them on YouTube or you know, even just to have them in our back pocket. One for any potential users, we<br />can link to those.<br />If they&#8217;re on YouTube, we can put those in our readme, which goes on the, you know, So it&#8217;s Crop Express in 30<br />seconds, a video in [00:28:00] that, in the Read Me Doc in the, in the repo. Um, and it gives you something to link<br />to when you&#8217;re having dis discussions because rather than you having to do a demo or people trying to figure it<br />out, you know, here&#8217;s, here&#8217;s a quick 32nd video, then let&#8217;s have a conversation.<br />Yeah. So it seems like if you agree that I feel like that should go on my list. Oh,<br />Cory Miller: if you&#8217;re good to put on your list, absolutely. Yeah, I<br />Corey Maass: can bang through those pretty<br />Cory Miller: quick. And that lends back to website is like having something where people can see it. Mm-hmm. .<br />Um, yeah, I&#8217;ll, okay, I&#8217;ll do some thinking on that.<br />Corey Maass: Yeah. Again, I feel like we&#8217;re, right now these are discussions, not decisions, but good ideas, so,<br />Yeah. Uh, ruminate on them a little bit today, and then, you know, this week or next, let&#8217;s make some decisions.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Okay? [00:29:00] All right. And I&#8217;ll continue. No matter what, there&#8217;s this. You know, as a developer, you&#8217;re like<br />building product and it&#8217;s, and it&#8217;s a straight line.<br />It&#8217;s a rocket ship going up, but it&#8217;s inevitable to do everything else. There&#8217;s, there&#8217;s the, the triangle. So as the<br />triangle goes up, it gets wider and wider. and wider. I&#8217;m just seeing it. It&#8217;s like I can just keep adding features. I can<br />just keep making the product better, but nobody&#8217;s gonna know about it.<br />Nobody gives a shit. There&#8217;s no, you know, but it&#8217;s like, Ever so slightly the more features then it&#8217;s like the more<br />you want a website, the more you want docs, the more you want, uh, feedback. The more you want assets, the<br />more you want swag, the more you want, you know, and it just keeps getting broader as, as much as it gets taller.<br />It feels like that<br />Cory Miller: It does, it def definitely blends over time. Um, okay, so I&#8217;ve got outreach and website to continue the<br />outreach outreach. Um, [00:30:00] I think Kathy, I think Robbie, when he&#8217;s back, um, I need to reach out to the<br />Elementor team.<br />Corey Maass: Do you have, um, like the starting in the conversation seemed good. Do you have a plan for<br />specific questions that we&#8217;re trying to get answered?<br />Um, or do you wanna leave it broad?<br />Cory Miller: What I intend to get to them with that is like getting to the heart of what are the things that annoyed<br />the team, building the themes. Mm-hmm. , what are they hearing from customers? Um, and, or even, even seeing<br />like they see sight and like the images just blown out and stuff.<br />And I, I want to keep those conversations open enough where they can tell us something I might surprise us that<br />goes in a particular direction.<br />So, and I think Rob Robbie&#8217;s very open to that. He just is out this week. So yeah, [00:31:00] sure. I&#8217;m really eager<br />to hear what he says. And that&#8217;ll be our first integration or, you know, potential integration for us thinking through<br />that. Um, so that&#8217;s kind of my intention. And then, uh, same thing with, um, any other theme framework from<br />Element towards generate press<br />sounds. But open. Do you have any thoughts or anybody else we should talk to? But you know, and then, well, the<br />story I&#8217;ll share too is like, here&#8217;s what free is gonna be, you know, and then to start to share the story to lead to this.<br />This could be a great tool for y&#8217;all to recommend to your communities kind of thing.<br />So I&#8217;ll, once I get some of those, I&#8217;ll drill down into, okay, cadence. What are the ratios, what are the things that we<br />could build into free to be, you know, that utility tool?<br />Corey Maass: Yeah, for sure. [00:32:00] So that, that&#8217;s kind of my plan there is just kind of digging in and seeing<br />what we hear. Trying to get to that true marrow of it.<br />Like how are people using it? What are you seeing? And hopefully be surprised. Love.<br />Um, and I&#8217;ll, I&#8217;ll do some thought too on the website. I know that&#8217;s been something we&#8217;ve been talking about,<br />um, but I like what you just said, like that solves the problem. If we switch to a branded site that talks ab, that&#8217;s, or<br />a company site that lets us be open up to anything, crop Express can stay the same.<br />Start to talk about the plugin and link back to what ultimately would be the shopping cart or the mm-hmm. , you<br />know, the main marketing site around it. But let crop.express as a website, be a lead magnet, a U [00:33:00] utility<br />site that is a lead magnet for the WordPress plugin. And for anything else, we end up spitting up.<br />Mm-hmm.<br />Cory Miller: Yeah. And then you&#8217;ve got a great free tool out there, so. Right. I do think, like you said, the banner<br />to, do you want the WordPress version, you know, you want this in WordPress and link over to the thing will be<br />helpful as we kind of grow for people to Yep. See the vision. Okay. All right. Anything else you had?<br />Corey Maass: No, I, I just, we&#8217;ve been, I like, I think I talked to you before. I, I&#8217;ve been watching Silicon Valley, so<br />I&#8217;m, I&#8217;m feeling like we need to scale up. We need to get some, um, venture capital. I need at least three more<br />developers under me.<br />Cory Miller: Um, I gotta get back and<br />Corey Maass: watch that. Move all of our operations out to Silicon Valley.<br />Of course. Hey, I&#8217;m in San Francisco in three weeks I&#8217;ll do our first raise. Um, I&#8217;ll talk to some angels out<br />Cory Miller: there. There you go. . When that came out, I, [00:34:00] I actually happened to have at the time a<br />little community car. It was a Ford Escape. Yellow, just like, uh, ,<br />Corey Maass: Avi Avik,<br />Cory Miller: ak a classic.<br />Corey Maass: All right, man. Well, good luck today.<br />Okay. It&#8217;ll be a long day. Hope you&#8217;ll be all right. Yeah. And, uh, I&#8217;ll<br />Cory Miller: appreciate that.<br />Corey Maass: Um, yeah, I&#8217;ll keep you posted.<br />Cory Miller: Okay, sounds good. And I&#8217;ll get these webinars back on the, reschedule them and put &#8217;em on our<br />calendars. Okay. So, sounds<br />Corey Maass: good. All right. Thanks.

The plugin is active on more than 500,000 websites.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Beau Lebens, WooCommerce&#8217;s Head of Engineering, published an <a href=\"https://developer.woocommerce.com/2023/03/23/critical-vulnerability-detected-in-woocommerce-payments-what-you-need-to-know/\">advisory</a> about the vulnerability today, which he said &#8220;could permit unauthorized admin access to impacted stores&#8221; if exploited. It was discovered by a security researcher participating in WooCommerce&#8217;s HackerOne program.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>WooCommerce worked with WordPress.org to push out a forced update for sites running WooCommerce Payments versions 4.8.0 through 5.6.1 to patched versions. Many store owners have automatic updates turned off to ensure proper testing before updating. Now that the vulnerability has been made public, it is imperative that all stores running version 4.8.0+ of the plugin update manually as soon as possible. WooCommerce sites hosted on WordPress.com, Pressable, and WPVIP have already been patched.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>At this time WooCommerce does not have any evidence of the vulnerability being exploited but the plugin&#8217;s engineers recommend checking for any unexpected admin users or posts addd to the site. The <a href=\"https://developer.woocommerce.com/2023/03/23/critical-vulnerability-detected-in-woocommerce-payments-what-you-need-to-know/\">advisory</a> includes further details of what to do if you believe your site has been impacted.

Generitive AI is decades old but recent advances and new tools like DALL-E (launched in January 2021) have made AI more accessible to the public. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>When <a href=\"https://chat.openai.com/chat\">ChatGPT</a> arrived in November 2022, it sparked an explosion of tools built to extend its capabilities to nearly every aspect of work. Conversational AI tools can now handle a myriad of mundane tasks like <a href=\"https://resumeworded.com/\">updating your resume</a>, <a href=\"https://askyourpdf.com/\">reading and summarizing PDFs</a>, and <a href=\"https://www.decktopus.com/\">creating slides for presentations</a>. Yesterday Google announced it is testing <a href=\"https://bard.google.com/\">Bard</a>, its AI chatbot rival to ChatGPT and Bing AI. In the fast-moving world of companies innovating with AI, GitHub also announced <a href=\"https://github.blog/2023-03-22-github-copilot-x-the-ai-powered-developer-experience/\">Copilot X</a>, which is powered by GPT-4 and adds Copilot to pull requests, docs, and the command line and introduces chat and voice features for Copilot.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>WordPress plugin developers are adopting AI-powered tech and building it into their products, such as <a href=\"https://rankmath.com/content-ai/\">RankMath&#8217;s AI-generated suggestions for creating SEO-friendly content</a>, WordPress.com&#8217;s experimental blocks for <a href=\"https://wptavern.com/wordpress-com-is-testing-ai-generated-images-and-content\">AI-generated images and content</a>, and a Setary&#8217;s plugin that <a href=\"https://setary.canny.io/changelog/effortlessly-enhance-your-product-descriptions\">uses AI to write and bulk edit WooCommerce product descriptions</a>. The wpfrontpage site is <a href=\"https://wpfront.page/list/ai-plugins/\">tracking</a> these plugins but WordPress.org also lists <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/search/ai/\">dozens</a> of plugins with AI, many of them created to write content or generate images.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In addition to adding AI to plugins, developers have attempted to have ChatGPT build plugins for them, with <a href=\"https://twitter.com/chuckWnelson/status/1636082994619244547\">varying</a> <a href=\"https://twitter.com/DarrenClasby/status/1638216096363708416\">degrees</a> of <a href=\"https://twitter.com/edyoung_tweets/status/1638324231174864896\">success</a>: </p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://wptavern.com/chatgpt-creates-a-working-wordpress-plugin-on-the-first-try\">ChatGPT Creates a Working WordPress Plugin – On the First Try</a></li>\n\n\n\n<li><a href=\"https://thewpminute.com/so-i-built-a-wordpress-plugin-with-chatgpt/\">So, I Built a WordPress Plugin With ChatGPT</a></li>\n\n\n\n<li><a href=\"https://www.zdnet.com/article/i-asked-chatgpt-to-write-a-wordpress-plugin-i-needed-it-did-it-in-less-than-5-minutes/\">I asked ChatGPT to write a WordPress plugin I needed.

In some cases the creation process is incomplete and requires some expertise to ensure the plugin will work, but it&#8217;s also opening up the world of plugin development to those who would not be able to create one without hiring a developer.</p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\">\n<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">I have never coded a WordPress plugin in my life<br /><br />With the help of Chat GPT 4, I just did<br /><br />In the span of ~30 mins, I was able to work with GPT4 to come up with a solution for my WooCommerce store to add a discount of 1.5% for product quantities above 1 w/ a cap set at 6%<br /><br />INSANE</p>&mdash; Amado Serna (@amado_serna) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/amado_serna/status/1637170105363886081?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">March 18, 2023</a></blockquote>\n</div>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\">\n<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">ChatGPT developed a WordPress plugin for us in just 3 minutes.

That said, <em>you</em> are 100% responsible for that code if you chose to host it here&#8230;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;But the important bit here is that it means if ChatGPT, for example, built your plugin, <strong>you</strong> have to verify that all the code used is GPL compatible. Just like you are expected to validate licenses on libraries and code-snippets, everything in your plugin has to be GPL compatible. Should we determine that your code is a copy of someone else’s or includes code from non-GPL plugins, your submission will be rejected and any live plugins will be closed.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Epstein cited an example where a developer built a &#8220;scroll to top&#8221; plugin with code that was copied from another, existing plugin hosted on WordPress.org. It was submitted five times and rejected every time. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;Yes it’s fine to fork code,&#8221; Epstein said. &#8220;You have to credit them, however, and that’s something those AIs have been pretty bad at doing.&#8221; </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Commenters noted that autocomplete in modern IDEs work in a similar way, as well as snippets. These types of tools can enhance productivity but prospective plugin developers who may not be as informed about software licensing, should stay away from wholesale copying another&#8217;s work without crediting them. This may require doing some extra research on the code that AI spits out.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In this new era of AI-assisted creation, we have essentially hitched our wagon to a star, as Ralph Waldo Emerson described in his essay on Civilization in 1870:</p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\">\n<p>Now that is the wisdom of a man, in every instance of his labor, to hitch his wagon to a star,’ and see his chore done by the gods themselves. That is the way we are strong, by borrowing the might of the elements. The forces of steam, gravity, galvanism, light, magnets, wind, fire, serve us day by day and cost us nothing.</p>\n<cite>Ralph Waldo Emerson, <a href=\"https://emersoncentral.com/essays/civilization/\">Civilization</a></cite></blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>That decade brought humanity inventions like the phonograph, telephone, and the incandescent light bulb, followed by the automobile in the next decade. Emerson&#8217;s essay explores man&#8217;s relationship to technology where principles—&#8221;justice, love, freedom, knowledge, utility&#8221;— are the guiding light and accelerant of technology&#8217;s impact.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The GPL is one of those principles for the WordPress community, which has enabled its uncommon growth and its wildly successful ecosystem. There are still a lot of grey areas when it comes to licensing and the code generated by AI. Developers would do well to use AI-generated code for inspiration and give credit where they can.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Web developer Mark Praschan <a href=\"https://twitter.com/MarkPraschan/status/1636025339926257664\">created his first plugin for WordPress.org</a> using ChatGPT. He used the free version, gave it a few prompts describing what he wanted it to do, and ChatGPT produced a functional plugin.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/northstar/\">NorthStar</a> allows users to display a message in the WordPress admin bar with settings to customize it along with the text and background colors.</p>\n\n\n\n<img />\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;The first version worked great,&#8221; Praschan said. &#8220;I made a few small aesthetic improvements to the settings page and the display of the message, but we were already 95% of the way there!&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Praschan also had ChatGPT design an ASCII Art logo for the plugin. It required a few back-and-forth prompts but took just a few minutes before it was ready to be copied and pasted into Photoshop. </p>\n\n\n\n<img />\n\n\n\n<p>The plugin did not pass the code review on the first try for two reasons that Praschan shared on Twitter:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li>Issue # 1: Variables and options must be escaped when echo&#8217;d. There were 2 instances of not &#8220;escaping late&#8221;</li>\n\n\n\n<li><a href=\"https://twitter.com/MarkPraschan\"></a>Issue # 2: Generic function/class/define/namespace names. One function was missing the &#8220;northstar_&#8221; prefix.</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;How did I fix it? I made ChatGPT do it, of course,&#8221; Praschan said. &#8220;I copy/pasted the problems and a few snippets of my code and it spat out the fixed code.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>There are more of these plugins coming &#8211; where a person need only dream up the idea and prompt their chosen AI tool for the code. These will more than likely be simple plugins for the time being, but it&#8217;s not too early to establish some best practices for using code generators. WordPress is navigating new territory where anyone can create a plugin with a dash of creative prompts and very little code experience.</p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Thu, 23 Mar 2023 04:29:36 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"Sarah Gooding\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:7;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:58:\"Post Status: WordPress 6.2 RC4 • Code Generators and GPL\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:32:\"https://poststatus.com/?p=148430\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:65:\"https://poststatus.com/wordpress-6-2-rc3-code-generators-and-gpl/\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:21999:\"<h2 id=\"h-this-week-at-wordpress-org-march-20-2023\">This Week at WordPress.org (March 20, 2023)</h2>\n\n\n<div class=\"has-background has-theme-palette-8-background-color wp-block-post-excerpt\"><p class=\"wp-block-post-excerpt__excerpt\">We&#8217;re just one week away from WordPress 6.2.

My name is Nathan Wrigley.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Jukebox is a podcast which is dedicated to all things WordPress, the people, the events, the plugins, the blocks, the themes, and in this case, why you might like to add Composer into your WordPress website workflow.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you&#8217;d like to subscribe to the podcast, you can do that by searching for WP Tavern in your podcast player of choice. Or by going to WPTavern.com forward slash feed forward slash podcast. And you can copy that URL into most podcast players.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you have a topic that you&#8217;d like us to feature on the podcast, I&#8217;m keen to hear from you, and hopefully get you or your idea featured on the show. Head to WPTavern.com forward slash contact forward slash jukebox, and use the form there.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So on the podcast today we have Chris Reynolds. Chris has been working with WordPress for over 15 years. He&#8217;s freelanced, worked with Event Espresso, WebDevStudios, Human Made, and is now at Pantheon as a CMS ecosystem engineer and WordPress technical lead.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>He&#8217;s spoken at WordCamps and at OpenWest about all aspects of WordPress.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I suspect that many of the people listening to this podcast are not using Composer in their WordPress workflow, and to Chris this is something that you should think about implementing, and he&#8217;s here to explain why.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Chris starts off by talking about the kinds of projects that he&#8217;s worked on, and how we found WordPress.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We then get into the weeds of what Composer is and the benefits that it brings. It&#8217;s essentially a package management system, and makes it easy to set dependencies for your project and manage them within Composer.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Why would you want to do that though? If you&#8217;re just building brochure websites, then perhaps you&#8217;ve don&#8217;t. But if your project is more complex then this might save you a lot of time.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Chris describes scenarios in which she thinks Composer is a good fit; if you want to add in specific packages and how those packages are managed and updated.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>He explains how you can install composer depending on the OS that you&#8217;re working with, and how it structures the files and directories that are created.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Towards the end of the podcast, we talk about how composer can be useful for teams, and Chris&#8217;s use of Composer to keep everyone clear on how the project is structured.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you&#8217;ve thought about using a package management system, such as composer, this episode is for you.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you&#8217;re interested in finding out more, you can find all of the links in the show notes by heading to WPTavern.com forward slash podcast, where you&#8217;ll find all the other episodes as well.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And so without further delay, I bring you Chris Reynolds.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I am joined on the podcast today by Chris Reynolds. Hello, Chris.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:03:40] Chris Reynolds: Hi. How&#8217;s it going?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:03:41] Nathan Wrigley: Very well, thank you. Chris is on the podcast today to talk to us about something that I confess I know very little about. I&#8217;m going to guess that if you&#8217;re a typical WordPress user, you too may be learning a few new things today. It&#8217;s all going to be about Composer. Before we get into Composer, what it is, how it works, and all of that, wouldn&#8217;t mind Chris if you just orientate our listeners. Give us a little bit of insight into you and your WordPress journey. The companies that you&#8217;ve worked at. The things that you&#8217;ve been involved in and so on. So over to you, Chris, give us your intro.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:04:14] Chris Reynolds: Sure. I came across WordPress right around the time that my son was born, which was 2005. The internet was a very different place back then, wasn&#8217;t it? At the time I was looking for something to like share pictures with family and stuff, make a website.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Back then I had what was then referred to as a weblog. It was before that was shortened to blogs, and it was literally a log of things that I did on my website, update changes. And that was all hard coded html. So when I was trying to think of something to share pictures, didn&#8217;t want to do it hard coded. I did do that for a little while and then I decided this was not the thing I wanted to be doing.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So there used to be a website called Hot Scripts. There I found a blogging platform called S Blog, and I was using that for a really long time. But as happens in open source, and actually honestly, as part of what happened in the WordPress history, the original maintainer and author disappeared for a little bit, and it wasn&#8217;t getting updates and I think there were some security things at some point. And I started looking for something else. Had some friends that were talking about WordPress, so I was like, I&#8217;ll try this thing out, and basically haven&#8217;t looked back.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>At a certain point after my son was born, I decided that I wanted to quit my regular job, which at the time was doing tech support for grocery stores, and become a freelance web designer. And I did that for a few years. Was familiar with all of those Elance and I don&#8217;t even remember all, like freelancer.net or something. Like all those really old sites to get freelance work. And I worked for a time for a company that&#8217;s actually local, as an outsource, freelance web designer.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>There, I believe owner, ran off with all their money or something, and the company closed down. That was a fun story. And then I met the folks from Event Espresso, which is a event management plugin. I met them at WordCamp Salt Lake City because they&#8217;re local, and Salt Lake City is where I live.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And I started working with them initially just doing tech support for them, and then I got into a little bit of development and then I got into a little bit of project management and development. And then I was at a WordCamp, I was speaking. And Pluralsight, which is an online training platform saw me speak and asked me if I wanted to do that sort of thing for them as a, as an author of WordPress related training courses.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So I started doing that while I was working at Event Espresso, and then eventually I quit to focus on that. And did that for about a year or so. And then, I started getting into agency world. So I worked at WebDevStudios for a couple years. And then I went to Human Made. I was there for almost five years. And now I&#8217;m working at Pantheon as a software engineer focusing on WordPress ecosystem things.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So I&#8217;ve been involved in very small projects. I&#8217;ve been involved in very large projects. I&#8217;ve been involved in training. For a while I did some work with the docs team for WordPress documentation. I went to the community summit in San Francisco way back in the day. I&#8217;ve spoken at lots of local WordCamps and OpenWest which is also held locally. And yeah, I&#8217;ve been around for a little while.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:07:12] Nathan Wrigley: Yeah, you really have. That&#8217;s an amazingly long history, and going back with WordPress to 2005, you really were right at the forefront. It was just the very beginnings at that point.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:07:22] Chris Reynolds: It had been around for a while. If you look at the screenshots of the admin, I wasn&#8217;t the very first iteration, but I think I was maybe the second iteration.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:07:31] Nathan Wrigley: Who knew back in 2005 that it would become such an important part of the ecosystem of the web in general. We&#8217;re at the point now where 40 plus percent, I still never quite know what that number means, but it&#8217;s a big number and WordPress is an important part of it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>You say that you&#8217;re a Pantheon at the moment. Just give us a little bit of insight into Pantheon because I confess, I don&#8217;t know a great deal about it. But in my mind I&#8217;m thinking managed WordPress hosting and also managed CMS hosting possibly some other variants as well. Just tell us a little bit about what Pantheons skin in the game is with WordPress.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:08:09] Chris Reynolds: You&#8217;re not wrong. We like to call ourselves a web ops platform and we also have kind of coined that web ops phrase, which means that outside of, speaking about Pantheon, it almost doesn&#8217;t exist. What web ops is, it&#8217;s website operations, right? It&#8217;s the things that make your website go.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And what that means practically is that the way that the platform has been built is from the ground up to make sure that teams are able to develop on their websites in a way that is easy to deploy, that is safe, and that is secure. And there&#8217;s all sorts of platform centric things that are part of the workflow.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Pantheon was one of the first, when I was working at WebDev, was the first exposure that I really had to Pantheon. And it was the first platform that I had used that had integrated Git. So you didn&#8217;t have to like, put your stuff on GitHub and then figure out a way to point that deploys to a server somewhere.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It was already built in. And they had been doing that from the very beginning. It also had as part of that there is a dev test live workflow where there&#8217;s separate environments. And this isn&#8217;t uncommon today, but it was one of the first places where you could do that and had it built in.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And then the real sort key feature that I enjoyed as a developer and still enjoy as an employee honestly is the concept of multi devs. Where if you have a branch that you are doing work on and you want to see what that branch would look like. Typically in my agency days, the way that you would handle this is by merging that into dev, and dev becomes really messy, dirty because it&#8217;s got lots of basically untested code, or code that was maybe tested and then rolled back or whatever.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Dev is always nasty, a nasty place to be, and you never deploy from dev. That was always the rule when I was working in agency stuff. Multi devs solve that problem by spinning up an entirely new environment for a branch. So you can create a multi dev off of whatever branch, and then you can test it there, and then you can merge that into dev or whatever.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Your dev branch is clean because it&#8217;s not, you&#8217;re not getting all this test code, experimental code that&#8217;s getting merged in, and then maybe you&#8217;re making some changes or maybe you&#8217;re fixing some stuff, undo some stuff that was from an old merge.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>That way you can keep your branches clean. And that&#8217;s a really cool thing that Pantheon does that I&#8217;ve often have wished for when I was working elsewhere, or working on sites that were not hosted on Pantheon. So that&#8217;s one of the things that Pantheon does.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We were talking before we started recording that Pantheon was built by four or five Drupal dudes. So it&#8217;s been a Drupal shop for a very long time. And then maybe about 10 or so years ago, when I became aware of them they started doing WordPress sites. Still built on the same infrastructure that they had built with all the same live workflows, multi dev, all that sort of stuff.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And now we&#8217;re getting into a point where we&#8217;re really trying to build out and optimize for WordPress and find where our gaps are in terms of how the platform has been built and what WordPress specifically needs. And that&#8217;s essentially what my team is involved in.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:11:10] Nathan Wrigley: Nice. Yeah, that&#8217;s a real interesting set of things that you talk about there. I didn&#8217;t actually know prior to our conversation we had before we hit record, I didn&#8217;t know that it had all begun on the Drupal side of things, but obviously as WordPress has been in the ascendancy for the last 10 years, it does feel like an important pivot for any company really to make, is to give an experience to WordPress users which is optimized for them.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So, yeah, I&#8217;ll make sure to link in the show notes to anything that we talk about. So if you&#8217;re listening to this, don&#8217;t worry too much, you can go to the WP Tavern website and search for this episode and find all the links there.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Now I&#8217;m going to include quite a few links to what we&#8217;re about to talk about. This is the main thrust of the podcast. It&#8217;s something called Composer. Now, when Chris reached out to me, he mentioned that he wanted to talk about Composer, and I&#8217;ll be really honest, it&#8217;s not something that I&#8217;m familiar with. Chris was very kind to gather a bunch of links, which I&#8217;ve now read, and I&#8217;ve tried to understand.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But I feel that Chris, you are going to school me today, so we&#8217;ll go right back to the basics. The first thing I think to mention is that I don&#8217;t think I know anybody else in the WordPress community who is using Composer with the sort of urgency that you feel it should be being adopted. Most of the people that I know are freelancers, possibly working in an agency and the typical workflow is, you know, if you&#8217;re working with a team, you&#8217;ve got a method of doing that.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But you may well be working on your own website. You may be working for client websites, and you&#8217;re just installing WordPress and a bunch of plugins and themes and so on and so forth. But you&#8217;ve got this bee in your bonnet about Composer and the virtues of it. So let&#8217;s go right back to the beginning. You&#8217;ve probably heard the word Composer before if you&#8217;re listening to this podcast, I imagine. But you may not know what it is. So let&#8217;s go there. What is Composer and why is it in any way important?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:12:59] Chris Reynolds: At its base Composer is a package management system. So if you&#8217;re at all familiar with npm which is primarily for JavaScript packages, maybe you&#8217;ve used that for Gutenberg stuff. Maybe you&#8217;ve used that for other JavaScript things. Composer is that thing for PHP packages.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In the past there were things like Pear and PECL, P E C L which did the same sort of thing. Composer does those same-ish things, but better. So at its core, it&#8217;s a package management system, which means it&#8217;s able to do like dependency management. And what that means is, if I have a package, and I have a certain version of a package.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Say I want php code sniffing, I can require that package with Composer. I can make sure that package is up to date. But I can also be specific about the versions of that package that I want to keep. Maybe I want to be on PHP code sniffing version eight or eight dot whatever, but I don&#8217;t want to upgrade to nine yet, or something like that.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I can be specific about my version dependencies, the versioning system that I&#8217;m choosing and be really, either really explicit. I can pin it to a specific release. I could do, I only want the security or patch releases. Or I could be really vague and say, just give me the latest version of whatever.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And Composer has, it&#8217;s based on the idea of semantic versioning. So as long as your packages and WordPress itself doesn&#8217;t use semantic versioning notably, and neither to do a couple other things like Yoast doesn&#8217;t do it, because they&#8217;re using sort of the version numbers don&#8217;t matter school of thought, which kind of breaks the whole thing a little bit.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But if you&#8217;re doing that sort of semantic versioning, which is common throughout just open source software in general, of major dot minor dot patch fr security then you can be really, you can update your things and feel fairly confident that an update is not going to break your thing, break your site. This is perhaps not a myth now as things in WordPress have improved. But the analogy that I like to think of and the reason why feel like Composer is, really important in a WordPress environment is the, I&#8217;ve got a million plugins, maybe not a million, maybe 20.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And I&#8217;ve got a couple themes and I go to my WordPress updates page, or maybe it&#8217;s got auto updates, right? And something happens and an update happens, and I wasn&#8217;t there. Either I bulk updated all of them or it happened in the background. Either way, I&#8217;m not looking at each individual update that I&#8217;m doing, and something breaks. My website white screens, and I have no idea what caused that problem.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I have to go back, I have to undo everything. I have to like, rename my plug-ins folder. I&#8217;m now in panic mode because my production site is white screening. It&#8217;s because of an update. It&#8217;s because something went through that I was either not paying enough attention to, or that happened automatically in the background that broke my site.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Composer, and the way that WordPress is built with allowing, essentially anybody who has access to the plugins page or the updates page to run those updates means that you&#8217;re putting the power and the control over administrating code that is deployed to your site, to whoever has access to those screens, right?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And Composer almost flips that and says, no, we&#8217;re going to give this power to people who actually touched the code. Who maybe are more aware of dependencies and change logs and what an update might mean to a site. And that&#8217;s, sort of where I, see the value of Composer just broadly.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:16:21] Nathan Wrigley: Okay. That was, yeah, a really interesting description of how it works. Could you give us the nuts and the bolts of that? In other words, could you unpack what&#8217;s going on? In other words, how is it, how is it installed? How do you get it to bind to the different variations? You mentioned, that you may want it to update to a certain version of such a thing. How do you actually do all of that?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:16:44] Chris Reynolds: Composer is software that runs on your computer. You can install basically anywhere. So if you&#8217;re on a Mac, you might use Homebrew to install it. You can run it on a Windows machine, it&#8217;s just a binary. You can run it on a Linux machine, there are packages for it. It&#8217;s essentially cross platforms, so you can use it or you can run it anywhere. Once you have it on your operating system. . Then, we&#8217;ll just use a WordPress, vanilla WordPress site, as an example, if I had a WordPress site maybe I do wget or download the zip file of WordPress and I unzip the package. Okay, that&#8217;s great.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And then I have Composer on my, on my, system so I can run at the command line Composer in it. And that&#8217;s going to start the process of building a Composer dot json file. And then once I have that Composer dot json file, I can start pulling in dependencies. I can say Composer require this thing, this package by this vendor.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And that&#8217;s going to, by default, install my dependencies into a vendor folder. Composer also has a built-in auto loading system. Which means that then in my project, if it&#8217;s a WordPress project, I can have a file. I could throw it into wp-content or a rather wp-config, or I can throw it into a mu plugin that loads the Composer auto loader file so that any packages that are being pulled in through Composer or libraries or whatever, are automatically pulled in because Composers does that, just does it for me.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If I&#8217;m doing WordPress specific things, what I would also need to put in my Composer file is a additional repository for W Packagist. So out of the box, Composer works with a platform, a website, a repository called Packagist, and that&#8217;s where all of the packages live.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you go to packagist.org today, you can do a search and you can find all sorts of stuff. What you won&#8217;t find is a ton of WordPress related stuff. You&#8217;ll find some. There&#8217;s Human Made has a ton of stuff up there, which I know because I worked there. And I&#8217;ve put a bunch of Pantheon things up there.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>There&#8217;s some other people who have been putting stuff on Packagist, just core like, Yoast notably has stuff up there. But it&#8217;s not a WordPress place, it&#8217;s just a general open source place, just like npm again. W Packagist is a bridge between the wordpress.org repository and Composer.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And it is just a mirror of the WordPress plugins and theme repositories for Composer based WordPress projects. So if you add W Packagist as a repository in your Composer json, now I can do Composer require and I can say W Packagist plugin slash WordPress SEO. And that&#8217;ll pull in the latest version of Yoast SEO into my Composer file.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Or I can say Composer require P Packagist theme 2010, and it&#8217;s going to pull in the 2010 theme, of most recent version. That&#8217;s sort of a little bit of the nuts and bolts. That&#8217;s how the Ccomposer json is built. You can also obviously edit this file manually. And then if you want to get into versioning, when you pull that stuff in, it&#8217;s going to give you a sort of its default. Which is typically the major dot minor with a little caret before it, which means that it&#8217;ll accept all minor versions, but it will pause if the version number, the latest version number changes for the major version, right?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>if it was like 1.5, 1.6, 1.7, 1.7.2, .3, .5 point whatever, all of those things would get pulled in. But as soon as that 1.7 turns to 2.0, because maybe they made a major release, it&#8217;s not going to get 2.0. It&#8217;s only going to be one point, whatever. Until I change that in my Composer file.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>That&#8217;s sort of the default setting. You can be more specific. You can go all the way out to the minor point release and just say, the only updates I ever want to get are these minor or patch releases. To make sure I&#8217;m getting all the security updates or whatever. And not getting minor version updates because maybe I&#8217;m afraid that one of those minor updates might do something bad, or I&#8217;m not, prepared for it yet. Or you can be very vague, and say, just star and give me everything. Or you could say just one, no points, just caret 10 or something. That means that anything above version 10 you&#8217;ll get, doesn&#8217;t matter what the point release is.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And that&#8217;s a way that you can solve for that white screen of death scenario that I talked about earlier. Because if I&#8217;m being specific and explicit about what versions I&#8217;m allowing in my updates then I&#8217;m not going to, I shouldn&#8217;t get to a point where something unexpected happens because of an update that happened that ran on my system.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And in addition to that the way that those updates happen at all is by me or an automation system running a Composer update command. And that&#8217;s the thing that says, go look for things that have changed and pull in any differences based on my defined versioning scheme.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:21:21] Nathan Wrigley: So you can get really granular with it. You can instruct it to do whatever you choose to do. I like the example there of pausing at the point release. So instead of going from 1.9 to two automatically it just pauses because it&#8217;s two. But 1.8 to 1.9 was okay to do. Yeah, it&#8217;s really interesting, you can get really granular. And then you run the command to run all of the updates and off it goes.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It sounds like, I could be wrong about this. It sounds like you could broadly break down your description for why to use Composer into three things. I&#8217;m thinking, first of all, security. It sounds like it provides, it&#8217;s not really providing security, but it&#8217;s providing security in the sense that it&#8217;s going to update plugins and themes and whatever else you may have coded yourself. It&#8217;s going to do that without your intervention. It&#8217;s going to run on a schedule and it&#8217;ll just get those things updated for you.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Which as we know in a lot of cases, a lot of WordPress websites, I don&#8217;t think the updates are happening for weeks, possibly months, who knows, maybe even years. So all of that gets taken care of. It also sounds like there&#8217;s a big time save here. If you can get this into your workflow, then you can step away from the dull task of updating things. This will just happen on the fly. You could have a setup in Composer that you reuse over and over again on a sort of typical website that you might set up.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And thereby you can just drag in all of the packages on day one of the project. And within moments you&#8217;re up and running with a typical install that you mentioned. Suck in a particular theme or suck in a particular SEO plugin or what have you. You just run the Composer and all of that is just dragged in and you&#8217;re off to the races. It&#8217;s a quick way to get started.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But also, you didn&#8217;t mention this, but it feels like this is a real win for teams. It feels like a team using this workflow, there may be benefits there. So broadly speaking, I&#8217;m talking about teams, times and security. Is there anything in that? Have I sort of got that about right?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:23:16] Chris Reynolds: Yeah, I think so. Obviously there needs to be an automated step somewhere in the process of actually running the Composer update. But beyond that, yes, absolutely. And interestingly one of the things that you touched on maybe accidentally even, the idea of sucking in all of these different packages. When I was at Human Made, I worked on Altis, and Altus is their digital experience platform.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And Altis is built almost entirely on Composer, and lots of cool Composer things happening. Altis itself is what&#8217;s known as a meta package. When you install Altis, the initial Composer file is just linking out to a whole bunch of other projects or packages that it brings in. And those themselves have their dependencies. So each, each of the modules, like the security module or the core module or whatever, each of those has its own set of dependencies that it pulls in. So it, really does just sort of like package a whole bunch of stuff that you get just for free when you initially set up a new site using that.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And that was one of the things that going from the idea of, oh, I&#8217;m just going to throw this Composer file in my WordPress site and call that good. That&#8217;s one of the things that really made me think, oh, actually there&#8217;s, there&#8217;s a lot more to it here. And one of the things that I first was exposed to when I was working at Human Made, and that I&#8217;m actively doing now with what I&#8217;m working on a Pantheon, is the concept of WordPress itself being just a dependency of your project.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And so like with the initial example, I&#8217;ve got a WordPress site. I unzip it. I throw my Composer, json in the root folder. That means that I&#8217;m using Composer probably to manage my plugins and themes, any other packages I might have. But I&#8217;m still using WordPress itself to update itself. Because WordPress is still part of that root directory, and it&#8217;s not part of the Composer structure.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>There are projects, there&#8217;s a couple things out there in the world that&#8217;s already, that have been existed, but one, a big thing that&#8217;s been part of the WordPress ecosystem for a while is by the Roots team called Bedrock. And that&#8217;s what we use at Pantheon. And that, among other things, what Bedrock does is it pulls WordPress in so that it can be a dependency. So that can be just another thing in your Composer file that is being versioned.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So again, same rules apply, right? You can say I want everything past six. You can say I want 6.1 dot anything beyond that. Or you can say, I only want 6.1.1, and when the next version comes out, I&#8217;m going to manually make that change so that I can be explicit about my testing process to make sure that I&#8217;m not going to ship broken code.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:25:42] Nathan Wrigley: Yeah, that&#8217;s really interesting. The idea that WordPress itself is a package. Okay. I can imagine, given the audience of this podcast, it really does span the whole community, you know. There&#8217;s people in every part of the WordPress ecosystem listening to this. And I can imagine there&#8217;ll be a certain proportion of them who as soon as you start to say things like npm and packages and all of this, and you mentioned, you know, things to do in the command line and da, da, da.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>They&#8217;re scratching their heads thinking I don&#8217;t know if this is for me. This all sounds a little bit complicated. So just address that. There&#8217;s a certain level of tech geeky here, I would imagine, But, is it difficult? Is the payback for a, let&#8217;s say a user who is just playing with five or six sites, they&#8217;ve got a few client sites and they can well manage to go in and update the plugins and the themes and all of the bits and pieces that they got set up.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Is there a use case here where, okay, if you&#8217;re sitting on that side of the fence, don&#8217;t even bother? This is probably not needed. Whereas if you&#8217;re on this side and you know you&#8217;ve got more sites than a certain number where it&#8217;s going to be of more use.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:26:47] Chris Reynolds: I mean, I definitely think that a lot of the freelancers that I know when I talk to are of the mind that, it&#8217;s just one more thing I need to worry about. And certainly if you are not going to on behalf of your clients go in and make updates, and you&#8217;re handing, once you&#8217;re done at your site, you&#8217;re handing that responsibility off to them.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It&#8217;s going to be too much work for your clients probably. I&#8217;m thinking like small business. I&#8217;m thinking like mom and pop shop. That sort of thing where it&#8217;s really just a user, one person or two people that are running the site. They&#8217;re probably not going to want to do stuff on the command line and you&#8217;re not going to want to train them and that&#8217;s fine.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But I think about when I was at WebDev and we were doing maintenance contracts with clients, and WordPress updates came around and we had basically a person dedicated to reading all of the change logs of every plugin on every site before making any updates. Just to make sure that nothing was going to happen that could potentially break.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And then if there was something that was maybe potentially breaking, they would have to like manually test that themselves on a dev environment, or a local environment or whatever. Just to make sure we&#8217;re not going to run an update and it&#8217;s going to break something. And I think that that process is very tedious and time consuming.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And that process is the process that you&#8217;re saving by using something where you can be more explicit like Composer. And you know that your updates are not going to break anything because the way that you&#8217;ve set up your versioning is the thing that you want it to be, and you feel confident about that structure so that when there are updates, you can go in and yeah, you still need to do testing, you still need to evaluate those things, but you know that you&#8217;re not going to accidentally push something out.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Or you can be at least fairly confident that you&#8217;re not going to accidentally push something out that&#8217;s going to break something. Because breaking things is not a good thing. It&#8217;s not a good feeling to have shipped something when you&#8217;re just doing a maintenance WordPress update release and your client is calling an hour later saying, why is my website white?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:28:42] Nathan Wrigley: Yeah, I guess in the case of some of the agencies where you&#8217;ve worked, so Human Made WebDevStudios and so on, it really is enterprise level stuff, and there is no scope for bringing a site down because of a careless update. So the notion that most WordPress users would go in and read the change log before clicking update.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I think that&#8217;s probably not the case. I would imagine most people are fairly cavalier because it&#8217;s their own site, or it&#8217;s a client site that they&#8217;ve got a backup of, and there&#8217;s some mitigation that they&#8217;re, doing all of that. But in the case that you&#8217;ve just outlined where, I don&#8217;t know, maybe these are international brands that we&#8217;ve heard of where the press damage alone in having a website go down for 50 minutes is just unconscionable. You&#8217;ve got to do the background research, and so having these systems in place is truly important.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:29:36] Chris Reynolds: Yeah, for sure.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:29:36] Nathan Wrigley: In terms of, we&#8217;ve been talking quite a lot about updates. I just wonder what your thoughts are on the, I mean, it&#8217;s not that recent, it&#8217;s several years ago now. The idea that in WordPress you can click a link in the, let&#8217;s say the plugin page. And you can say just go on, update. Whenever something new rolls out, just get on with it and update it. So you can, if you like, trust it. What are your thoughts on that?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:29:58] Chris Reynolds: I think it&#8217;s nice for the people that it&#8217;s good for. And I think it&#8217;s definitely helped with WordPress adoption. Because if all I was doing, if I wasn&#8217;t a WordPress developer and all I was doing was being a podcaster and I had a website that was just about my podcast. I&#8217;m not going to care about code. I&#8217;m never going to want to touch the code. I&#8217;m going to want to install WordPress and never look at FTP, or know my server configuration, or care about my database.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>None of that. None of that is interesting to me. What I want is I want to plug it in, turn it on, and let it run. And be fairly confident that it is going to continue to run when I have my eyes closed and I&#8217;m not looking at it. So I think that it&#8217;s nice in the sense of creating an ecosystem in which things that you do in WordPress are relatively easy. And the counterpoint to that, I work at Pantheon. Pantheon&#8217;s been involved in the Drupal committee for a very long time.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Talking earlier too about how Drupal has, I think since version eight, integrated Composer into the core of how Drupal works. So sort of the antithesis of this idea of, I&#8217;m going to turn it on and set auto update and then walk away, is the idea of Composerizing everything. So that every change is a code level change.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And what I&#8217;ve found interesting, that I&#8217;ve learned over the last year of being at Pantheon in a difference between the sort of like Drupal ecosystem and WordPress ecosystem, is in WordPress, yeah, there are some people who make it their job to kind of do just general site administration for people.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But it&#8217;s not a huge thing. It&#8217;s like there&#8217;s a couple people that do that sort of thing or they don&#8217;t actually touch the code, but they will do your WordPress updates and that sort of thing for you. In Drupal, there&#8217;s entire agencies where all of what they&#8217;re doing is essentially that, just the maintenance stuff of having a website.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And part of that is because the Drupal admin is a lot more complicated to use, to create sites and pages and views and all sorts of things. It&#8217;s a lot more complicated than the WordPress admin, which I credit to how WordPress is built personally. But the other part of it is the understanding of like, when it&#8217;s okay to update this Drupal module to the next version or that sort of thing. To be aware of what&#8217;s happening on their other sites. And then what combinations work together and that sort of thing.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>There&#8217;s a whole ecosystem that it&#8217;s really just essentially website management, which doesn&#8217;t exist in the same way in WordPress. And so that&#8217;s sort of what we&#8217;re talking about. The difference between having really hands-on updates. Making sure that things are safe to do. Or making it so that the people who actually do the content editing or other administration on the site, they don&#8217;t have to worry about the stuff that&#8217;s happening in the background because they know somebody&#8217;s taking care of it, versus having just the software take care of that for itself.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And so I think there&#8217;s a place for it. And I think that the reason why WordPress has grown so much over the last many years is because it&#8217;s embraced this, well, we&#8217;re going to just auto update things and not have people stress over that stuff. But, also like the reason why there&#8217;s so many people that are holding onto Drupal is because they want to make sure, they want to ensure that their site is stable and secure and all of those things. And that those things matter for really big companies. It is that divide, right of more casual users versus the enterprise level stuff.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:33:09] Nathan Wrigley: I guess because Composer is essentially nothing to do with WordPress. I mean, you know, you&#8217;ve described a scenario in which WordPress can combine with it, which is very helpful. Updating plugins, themes and so on and so forth. I guess this can reach beyond WordPress. So if you&#8217;ve got something bespoke, unique, you&#8217;ve got a package, which is nothing to do with WordPress. Composer can take care of that as well.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:33:34] Chris Reynolds: Yeah, and it&#8217;s really useful when you, so in both npm and Composer, there&#8217;s the concept of dev dependencies. And these are dependencies that will install when you do like a Composer install. But you can also say, you can omit the developer dependencies on your production installs, right?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And that means that you can run things like linting and unit testing and all that sort of stuff, which doesn&#8217;t matter if it&#8217;s on the prod site. But maybe if you&#8217;re going to push it to your dev site or you&#8217;re going to keep it on your local machine. And you can manage all those things really easily with Composer.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>There&#8217;s definitely WordPress coding standards and there&#8217;s WordPress suites for unit testing. Those things all exist and you can manage those in WordPress. But essentially, like the core thing, like PHP Code Sniffer is not a WordPress thing. It&#8217;s just a, it&#8217;s just a package that exists in the world. And same thing as PHP unit. It&#8217;s just a thing that exists in the world that we have adopted and embraced and brought it into our ecosystem. So for sure, yeah, there&#8217;s definitely value of using Composer to manage sort of like external things.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:34:29] Nathan Wrigley: Okay, given that if you went down this route and you made Composer an integral part of your process. You then to some extent become dependent upon the functioning of Composer for your whole process to work. And so that brings me to the Composer ecosystem.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So we&#8217;re all always talking about how great the WordPress ecosystem is. There&#8217;s a forum for this. There&#8217;s a Slack channel for that. If you want to find something out there&#8217;s ways of learning. Is the same true of Composer? It&#8217;s an open source project. Does it have a thriving community? Does it receive the updates that one would hope? Does it progress in the same way that we hope WordPress does? Does it have that same feel? Are there resources for learning and so on?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:35:07] Chris Reynolds: Well, I will say that the website for Composer getcomposer.org, I believe, is really, the documentation&#8217;s really good. At its core, it&#8217;s a pretty simple idea. The documentation&#8217;s pretty self-explanatory. Where it gets hairy is the distinction between a caret versus a squiggly line, in terms of how you&#8217;re going to do your versioning stuff.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Because there&#8217;s a very subtle but specific difference there. And how to pull in different repositories or how to do more complex things. It gets a little bit hairy. But again, the documentation is all there and it&#8217;s all really good and I found it very useful.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And there&#8217;s enough people in the open source ecosystem generally that are using Composer, that it&#8217;s not terribly difficult to find answers to any questions about Composer. Most things you would encounter have probably been done by someone, and there&#8217;s probably some prior art that you can use to base it on.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So I think that it&#8217;s generally pretty good. And packagist is a great place to find stuff. What I will do when I&#8217;m looking for stuff is I&#8217;ll look on packages, even if I&#8217;m looking for a WordPress thing, just to see if, if that developer has pushed their thing to packages before even looking at wordpress.org, or pulling it in from the W Packagist mirror.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>That means it&#8217;s getting a little bit, it&#8217;s like one step closer to the source, right? Because all Packagist does really, to submit a package on Packagist, here&#8217;s your pro tip. You have an account obviously, and then you just say, submit a package and you give it a GitHub repository url, and then it just looks at GitHub. And as long as the GitHub project uses releases, even if it doesn&#8217;t really need to, it just looks at the branches. But if it has releases, then you will have those versions. And if it doesn&#8217;t have releases you can still pull that stuff in using a dev prefix or whatever.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>That stuff is all self-contained. It all exists. It&#8217;s all well-maintained, all that sort of stuff. That&#8217;s all good. Composer itself does occasionally get updates. The last big thing was sort of a transition from Composer one to Composer two. And that was a little bit of a, there&#8217;s definitely some growing pains in the transition process of going from one version to the next.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And then they threw a wrench recently, not super recently. But they threw a wrench into things a little bit where there is a new thing that goes into your Composer file called allowed plugins. So if it, if it&#8217;s a dependency is calling something else or whatever. You have basically have to give permission to other vendors to, install things on your behalf. So as long as you, if they&#8217;re in the allowed plugins list then those things will get updated, and if they&#8217;re not in the allowed plugins list, then it&#8217;s not going to update those things. And I believe that was for like, security type things.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>That did cause a problem with you know, at Pantheon we have a lot of stuff that&#8217;s based on Composer and we don&#8217;t want to introduce merge conflicts. So if we have a Composer file, that is basically the thing that is used to build sites. And then suddenly that Composer file needs to have a new part of the Composer file, and we push that change. It&#8217;s going to cause a merge conflict with everybody&#8217;s repository that didn&#8217;t already have that.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So it&#8217;s a little bit of a headache for us, but for the user it&#8217;s obviously a net win. Those sorts of things give me pause a little bit, as somebody who is now at least partially responsible for, thousands of people running sites that use Composer. But in terms of like individual users and stuff, I think that Composer has a really good thing going and has a good ecosystem around it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:38:16] Nathan Wrigley: Just to give us some insight into how you are using it. Your work at Pantheon and all the other companies that you&#8217;ve mentioned that you&#8217;ve worked at. Is this something that is just typical? This is just part of the process. Everything is built with Composer bolted in. Or is this something that you cherry pick? Okay, this one needs it, this one doesn&#8217;t. Is it basically everywhere, all the time?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:38:38] Chris Reynolds: When I was at WebDev, which admittedly is many years ago now, we didn&#8217;t use Composer. We could have benefited from using Composer. And I think they&#8217;re probably using Composer now. I don&#8217;t know that for sure, but based on the types of projects that they&#8217;re doing, and types of things that I see them working on, I think that&#8217;re probably doing it now.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>When I was at Human Made, it was just there. Everything that we did had Composer as part of it. And it was a sort of a fundamental part of how projects were built. And obviously like Altis is Composer. It&#8217;s a Composer built thing. It&#8217;s entirely built on top of Composer. One of the things that gives it its stability, but also if you look at the documentation for Altis or things, it&#8217;s always lagging, and is always going to be lagging a little bit behind the latest WordPress release.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And for enterprise, that&#8217;s fine. Because they&#8217;re not concerned about the major or minor point releases. They&#8217;re concerned that their site is secure and it&#8217;s updated and it&#8217;s getting those patch releases. So with each new Altis version that typically aligns with a new WordPress version it sort of, when I was there anyway, the release cycle for Altis followed by a month or so, offset from the last WordPress release, so that they could make sure that the next WordPress version was part of the next Altis version.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:39:48] Nathan Wrigley: Okay, so should somebody have been interested in this, you know, their interest has been peaked by everything that you&#8217;ve been saying. Where&#8217;s some good resources? I&#8217;m looking at getcomposer.org and there&#8217;s a get started link right at the top. That seems like it might be a decent place to start. But maybe there&#8217;s more, how to describe it? Maybe there&#8217;s some things which would help a WordPresser as well.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:40:13] Chris Reynolds: I definitely would point towards the Roots Bedrock Project as being a really good place if you&#8217;re looking at wanting to have WordPress as built as dependency, I think they&#8217;ve got a really good framework. And at Human Made, we were doing that thing, but we weren&#8217;t using Bedrock. So it would be a little bit more difficult to come up with those ideas and that system and that framework independently. And that&#8217;s one of the things I think that you would get from the Roots ecosystem. So definitely yeah the, just the get Composer to learn about it and to look at the documentation, to dig into it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And then from a WordPress standpoint specifically, I would definitely look into Bedrock to understand like how that works. And they&#8217;ve got a thriving community as well around that. And, a whole Patreon thing and Discord channel and whatnot, so that you can actually talk to human beings and get some amount of support.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:41:02] Nathan Wrigley: Yeah I&#8217;ll make sure to link to everything that you sent in my direction into the show notes. But, if anybody wants to check those out, you can see them on the WP Tavern website. Search for this episode, and you&#8217;ll be able to see all of those links there. If anybody wants to link to you Chris, if anybody&#8217;s been interested in, just think they&#8217;d like bit of a helping hand. They&#8217;d like to understand this a little bit more from, from the horse&#8217;s mouth if you like. Where do we find you?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:41:27] Chris Reynolds: Online I&#8217;m jazz sequence most places. Frequently jazz sequence with a three. So j a z z s 3 q u e n c e. That&#8217;s my Twitter handle and Instagram, various other things. I am at @jazzsequence@mstdn.social on Mastodon. And, my website is jazzsequence.com without the three, cause I like to, be confusing. And LinkedIn and places like that. But the Twitters and lately Mastodon, and those sorts of social places where you&#8217;ll probably get my attention.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I&#8217;m also, you know, on the WordPress Core Slack and like I said I live in Salt Lake City so, we haven&#8217;t had very many WordCamps in the last couple years. There&#8217;s some weird pandemic thing happening, but when those things do happen I often will try to visit the things that are, within driving range. I&#8217;m hoping to be at at US in National Harbor this year. So, maybe I&#8217;ll see folks there.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:42:16] Nathan Wrigley: Nice. Chris Reynolds, thank you for joining us on the podcast today. I appreciate it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:42:20] Chris Reynolds: Yeah, no worries.</p>\n</div>\n\n\n\n<p>On the podcast today we have <a href=\"https://twitter.com/jazzs3quence\">Chris Reynolds</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Chris has been working with WordPress for over 15 years. He’s freelanced, worked with Event Espresso, WebDevStudios, Human Made and is now at Pantheon as a CMS Ecosystem engineer, and WordPress technical lead. He’s spoken at WordCamps and at OpenWest about all aspects of WordPress.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I suspect that many of the people listening to this podcast are not using Composer in their WordPress workflow, and to Chris, this is something that you should think about implementing, and he’s here to explain why.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Chris starts off by talking about the kind of projects that he’s worked on, and how he found WordPress.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We then get into the weeds of what Composer is, and the benefits that it brings. It’s essentially a package management system and makes it easy to set dependencies for your project and manage them within Composer.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Why would you want to do that though? If you’re just building brochure websites, then perhaps you don’t, but if your project is more complex, then this might save you a lot of time.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Chris describes scenarios in which he thinks Composer is a good fit; if you want to add in specific packages, and how those packages are managed and updated.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>He explains how you can install Composer depending on the OS that you’re working with, and how it structures the files and directories that are created.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Towards the end of the podcast, we talk about how Composer can be useful for teams, and Chris’ use of Composer to keep everyone clear on how the project is structured.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you’ve thought about using a package management system such as Composer, this episode is for you.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Useful links.</h2>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.hotscripts.com/\">Hot Scripts</a></p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://eventespresso.com/\">Event Espresso</a></p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.pluralsight.com/\">Pluralsight</a></p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://webdevstudios.com/\">WebDevStudios</a></p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://humanmade.com/\">Human Made</a></p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://pantheon.io/\">Pantheon</a></p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.npmjs.com/\">npm</a></p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://brew.sh/\">Homebrew</a></p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://wpackagist.org/\">WordPress Packagist</a></p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://packagist.org/\">Packagist</a></p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://roots.io/bedrock/\">Bedrock by the Roots Team</a></p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://getcomposer.org/\">Composer</a></p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://twitter.com/jazzs3quence\">Chris&#8217; Twitter account</a></p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://mstdn.social/@jazzsequence\">Chris&#8217; Mastodon account</a></p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://jazzsequence.com/\">Chris&#8217; website</a></p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Wed, 22 Mar 2023 14:00:00 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:14:\"Nathan Wrigley\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:9;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:60:\"WordPress.org blog: Introducing the WordPress Developer Blog\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:35:\"https://wordpress.org/news/?p=14649\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:76:\"https://wordpress.org/news/2023/03/introducing-the-wordpress-developer-blog/\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:4659:\"<p>With much activity happening in the WordPress development space every day, keeping up-to-date with the latest updates can be challenging.

What WordPress swag collector can pass up the WP20 Wapuu keychain?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Unlike years past, where the swag store seemed like its own separate site, this relaunch makes the store a  more natural part of the WordPress project&#8217;s website. It runs on WooCommerce and shares the same <a href=\"https://wptavern.com/wordpress-news-gets-a-new-design\">updated design</a> as the rest of WordPress.org with the vibrant blue that has made its way into the 20th anniversary logos. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The limited edition swag is available while supplies last. Unfortunately, international shipping rates are hefty, a complaint the store has received for years. It makes it cost-prohibitive to order a single t-shirt or sweatshirt outside the U.S. when the shipping costs twice as much or more than the product. Hopefully, this year&#8217;s docket of WordCamp events will provide other avenues for distributing 20th anniversary swag to WordPress&#8217; global community through well-stocked pop-up shops.</p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Wed, 22 Mar 2023 03:21:31 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"Sarah Gooding\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:11;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:76:\"WPTavern: Admin Menu Tree Page View 2.8 Now Supports All Public Post Types \";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:30:\"https://wptavern.com/?p=142881\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:85:\"https://wptavern.com/admin-menu-tree-page-view-2-8-now-supports-all-public-post-types\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:2211:\"<p>The <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/admin-menu-tree-page-view/\">Admin Menu Tree Page View plugin</a>, which adds a tree-view layout of content in the WordPress admin, has been refactored to support more content types. The plugin is an admin utility similar to <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/hierarchy/\">Hierarchy</a> or the commercial <a href=\"https://organizewp.com/\">OrganizeWP</a> plugin that reworks the CMS to show content in one place, but it offers a simpler set of features for free with no ads or upsells.  These types of plugins are valuable tools on larger, CMS-heavy WordPress sites.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Previously, the Admin Menu Tree Page View plugin focused on pages, allowing users to better visualize the page hierarchy/tree structure, add pages directly after or inside another post, and easily reorder pages via drag and drop.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://getbutterfly.com/admin-menu-tree-page-view-2-8-refactoring-update/\">Version 2.8</a> adds support for all public post types &#8211; posts, pages, and custom post types, which was a long requested feature. The plugin&#8217;s author, WordPress developer Ciprian Popescu, said adding more post types made the dashboard menu unmanageable and the backend slow, requiring him to update the plugin to us a top-level menu page.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;The solution here was to move the pages to a top level menu page,&#8221; Popescu said. &#8220;This increased the &#8216;one click away&#8217; feature to &#8216;two clicks away,&#8217; which is not a bad trade-off in my opinion, especially when all public post types are now available in a hierarchical tree layout. Having a separate page now removed the need for collapsing the child <code>&lt;ul></code> elements, as the purpose of this plugin is to quickly see all your pages in a bird’s eye view manner.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<img />\n\n\n\n<p>Version 2.8 also removes some redundant features, cookies, and JavaScript resources, as the expand/collapse functionality is no longer necessary. Next on the roadmap for future releases Popescu is working on adding caching for post types, removing the jQuery and jQueryUI dependency, and improving dragging and dropping to work inside child elements. </p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Tue, 21 Mar 2023 23:10:04 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"Sarah Gooding\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:12;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:53:\"WordPress.org blog: WordPress 6.2 Release Candidate 3\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:35:\"https://wordpress.org/news/?p=14685\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:69:\"https://wordpress.org/news/2023/03/wordpress-6-2-release-candidate-3/\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:4880:\"<p>It’s the final countdown: the third (and last) scheduled <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/handbook/glossary/#release-candidate\">release candidate</a> (RC3) for WordPress 6.2 is ready! </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The WordPress 6.2 release is scheduled for March 28, 2023—just one week away!

Instead, it is recommended that you test RC3 on a test server and site.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>You can test WordPress 6.2 RC3 in three ways:</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Option 1</strong>: Install and activate the <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/wordpress-beta-tester/\">WordPress Beta Tester</a> plugin (select the “Bleeding edge” channel and “Beta/RC Only” stream).</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Option 2</strong>: Direct download the <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/wordpress-6.2-RC3.zip\">RC3 version (zip)</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Option 3</strong>: Use the following WP-CLI command:</p>\n\n\n\n<p><code>wp core update --version=6.2-RC3</code></p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">A shout out to plugin and theme developers</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Your products are the reason WordPress does so many things for more people across the world. As you test your latest versions against RC3, make sure you update the “<em>Tested up to”</em> version in your plugin’s readme file to 6.2. If you find compatibility problems, please post detailed information to the <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/support/forum/alphabeta/\">support forums</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Check out the <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/2023/03/09/wordpress-6-2-field-guide/\">WordPress 6.2 Field Guide</a> for more details about the major changes in this release.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Help translate WordPress</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Do you speak a language other than English? <a href=\"https://translate.wordpress.org/projects/wp/dev\">Help translate WordPress into more than 100 languages.</a>&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Keep WordPress bug-free—help with testing</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Without your testing support, hitting important product milestones would be a much bigger challenge. It’s also a meaningful way to contribute to the project. If you’re new to testing, or it’s been a while, <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/test/2023/02/07/help-test-wordpress-6-2/\">this detailed guide</a> can help you get started.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you think you have run into an issue, please report it to the <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/support/forum/alphabeta/\">Alpha/Beta area</a> in the support forums.

The capacity for this event is about 120 people, so getting tickets early is advised.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>WordCamps are held worldwide, locally run and purposely at a low cost for accessibility to all. WordCamp Buffalo is dedicated to WordPress, blogging and web facility. WordCamps are sponsored by WordPress, the open-source, free, not-for-profit platform for individuals, groups and businesses to build their own blogs and websites. WordPress.org began in 2003. Its administrators call it the “largest self-hosted blogging tool in the world, used on millions of sites and seen by tens of millions of people every day.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Similar to previous years, Buffalo’s 2023 WordCamp will divide its workshops along two tracks, with sessions for every ability and level of use.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Speakers will include WordPress users from Buffalo, Rochester, and beyond, with experience ranging from user/blogger to advanced developer.</p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Fri, 17 Mar 2023 14:30:13 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:18:\"Michelle Frechette\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:19;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:57:\"WordCamp Central: WordCamp Entebbe 2023: An Amazing Recap\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:39:\"https://central.wordcamp.org/?p=3163170\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:81:\"https://central.wordcamp.org/news/2023/03/wordcamp-entebbe-2023-an-amazing-recap/\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:4374:\"<p>WordCamp Entebbe, a two-day event that took place on the 10th and 11th of March, 2023, was a resounding success and was attended by over 200 people. The event, which was focused on the WordPress content management system, drew attendees from across Uganda and beyond. However, what made this event stand out was its commitment to gender diversity in the tech industry.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The organizers of WordCamp Entebbe made a concerted effort to ensure that women were well-represented at the event. The gender diversity program featured female speakers and student attendees. This program was designed to inspire more women to pursue careers in technology, and it proved to be a huge success.</p>\n\n\n\n<img src=\"https://masterwp.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/image2-1024x683.jpg\" alt=\"A person stands on a stage with a microphone.\" />\n\n\n\n<img src=\"https://masterwp.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/image4-1024x683.jpg\" alt=\"The group poses for a photo.\" width=\"670\" height=\"446\" />Students pose for a group photo with the lead organiser Arthur Kasirye \n\n\n\n<img src=\"https://masterwp.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/image6-1024x683.jpg\" alt=\"The group poses for a photo.\" />Students arriving at the WordCamp\n\n\n\n<p>Over the course of the two-day event, attendees had the opportunity to attend a wide range of sessions, workshops, and presentations. Many of these were led by female speakers who shared their experiences and expertise with the audience.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The topics covered ranged from beginner-level introductions to WordPress to more advanced topics such as website optimization, content creation, and web security.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>One of the most inspiring sessions of the event was a panel discussion on women in tech. This session featured female leaders in the Ugandan tech industry who shared their experiences and insights with the audience. The panelists talked about the challenges they had faced as women in a male-dominated industry and offered advice on how to overcome those challenges.</p>\n\n\n\n<img src=\"https://masterwp.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/image7-1024x684.jpg\" alt=\"A group is sitting in chairs.\" />Women Panel at the Wordcamp\n\n\n\n<img src=\"https://masterwp.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/image5-1024x880.jpg\" alt=\"The group poses for a photo.\" />\n\n\n\n<p>Another highlight of WordCamp Entebbe was the student program. This program provided an opportunity for students to attend the event and learn more about WordPress and the tech industry in general. The students were able to attend workshops and presentations, network with professionals in the industry, and gain valuable insights into the world of tech as well as introduced to the new study curriculum of the Directorate of Industrial Training (DIT) a Ugandan quality assurance directorate offering nationally, regionally and internationally recognized quality assurance services for the Business, Technical, Vocational Education and Training (BTVET) were students can use WordPress in their final year projects and graded on a national level.</p>\n\n\n\n<img src=\"https://masterwp.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/image3-1024x683.jpg\" alt=\"A group is observing a laptop.\" />Students learning to install WordPress website\n\n\n\n<p>This year’s WordCamp was led by Kasirye Arthur the leader of the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.meetup.com/entebbe-wordpress-meetup/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">WordPress Community in Entebbe</a>&nbsp;who is also a community lead for&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.meetup.com/kampala-woocommerce-meetup-group/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Woocommerce</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.meetup.com/elementor-uganda-meetup-group/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Elementor</a></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Overall, WordCamp Entebbe was a hugely successful event that demonstrated the power of gender diversity in the tech industry.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>By creating a program that was focused on empowering women in Tech, the organizers of this event helped to inspire a new generation of female technologists. It is our hope that more events like WordCamp Entebbe will be organized even in schools so that we can continue to build a more diverse and inclusive tech industry.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<img src=\"https://masterwp.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/image8-1024x684.jpg\" alt=\"The group poses for a photo.\" width=\"670\" height=\"447\" />WordCamp Entebbe organising Team\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Fri, 17 Mar 2023 09:30:42 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:14:\"Kasirye Arthur\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:20;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:105:\"WPTavern: Equalize Digital Raises Pre-Seed Funding for Expanding Accessibility Checker Plugin Development\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:30:\"https://wptavern.com/?p=142818\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:116:\"https://wptavern.com/equalize-digital-raises-pre-seed-funding-for-expanding-accessibility-checker-plugin-development\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:3689:\"<p>Equalize Digital, a WordPress accessibility products and consulting company, has <a href=\"https://equalizedigital.com/equalize-digital-receives-investment-emilia-capital/\">received an undisclosed amount of pre-seed funding</a> from Emilia Capital, the investment company owned by Joost de Valk and Marieke van de Rakt. The investment will be used to accelerate the growth of Equalize Digital&#8217;s <a href=\"https://equalizedigital.com/accessibility-checker/\">Accessibility Checker plugin</a>, a tool for auditing websites for WCAG, ADA, and Section 508 accessibility errors.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Emilia Capital now owns part of the company, although its owners were not given seats on the board. Equalize Digital founder and CEO Amber Hinds said they will be serving as advisors and playing a role in strategic planning, especially around marketing and plugin development.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Accessibility Checker plugin currently has approximately 2,000 active installs, according to <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/accessibility-checker/\">WordPress.org stats</a>, and the commercial upgrades make up a small percentage of Equalize Digital&#8217;s current revenue.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;We built the initial MVP in 2020 with an SBA loan and since then the plugin has been bootstrapped by profits from the service side of our business,&#8221; Hinds said. &#8220;My partner Steve and I have been splitting our time between client work and working on the plugin.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;We decided to bring on an investor because our ultimate goal is for the product to make up a significant portion of our revenue. It&#8217;s challenging to rapidly grow a product that isn&#8217;t yet self-sustaining, hence seeking investors. The funds will allow us to have full-time team members building new features, and also further invest in marketing, education, and sales than was possible while we were bootstrapping.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Hinds said the features her team is targeting are aimed at making the plugin a more competitive accessibility auditing tool when compared with other existing SaaS solutions. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;Our focus right now is making our reports easier to understand by less technical users,&#8221; Hinds said. &#8220;The next major release with be a feature that allows people to click a button and highlight elements on the front end of the website, which will make it easier to find the element flagging the issue without having to interpret a code snippet.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;Other features that we have on the road map include scanning and reporting on archive pages for posts and taxonomies, improved scanning of non-English sites, and the ability for accessibility testers to log issues found during manual accessibility audits.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Hinds said she was encouraged by the findings in the recent <a href=\"https://theadminbar.com/2023-survey/\">Admin Bar survey of WordPress professionals</a>, which showed that 76.9% report they are striving for best practices when it comes to website accessibility, a significant increase from the previous year. With the new investment, Equalize Digital will be able to do more marketing to increase awareness and adoption of its tools.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;Ultimately I would like to see accessibility being considered during website builds in the same way that SEO is, and we&#8217;re hoping that our plugin will central to that,&#8221; Hinds said. &#8220;It&#8217;s why the free version of our plugin is much more full-featured than similar plugins. Other accessibility tools are prohibitively expensive for small businesses and bloggers. We&#8217;re aiming to build a tool that makes accessibility testing available to everyone.&#8221;</p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Fri, 17 Mar 2023 03:33:33 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"Sarah Gooding\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:21;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:63:\"WPTavern: Local 6.7.0 Adds Long-Requested Site Grouping Feature\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:30:\"https://wptavern.com/?p=142784\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:74:\"https://wptavern.com/local-6-7-0-adds-long-requested-site-grouping-feature\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:2533:\"<p>WP Engine&#8217;s <a href=\"https://localwp.com/\">Local</a> development app has released <a href=\"https://localwp.com/releases/6.7.0/\">version 6.7.0</a> with Site Grouping, a highly requested feature that will greatly improve users&#8217; workflows.

In June 2022, the Local development team began designing and then building the feature a couple months later, incorporating feedback from user interviews and usability testing.</p>\n\n\n\n<p> In the new Site Grouping feature, sites can be easily dragged between groups and groups can be reordered up or down, as illustrated in the release notes.</p>\n\n\n\n<img /><a href=\"https://localwp.com/releases/6.7.0/\">Local 6.7.0 release notes</a>\n\n\n\n<p>Another handy feature released with Site Grouping is the ability to start, stop, restart, or delete all the sites in a group from the context menu (the three dots to the right of the group name). Sites can also be sorted by how recently they were used via the clock icon at the top of the groups sidebar. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>To get users started, all their Starred sites have been placed in a new Starred group at the top of the sidebar.

They highlight accessibility as a non-negotiable aspect of web development and provide guidance for leaders, developers, and designers to ensure your websites are accessible to all people.</p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio\"><strong>Top Takeaways:</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<ul type=\"video\" class=\"wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio\">\n<li><strong>Why Value Accessibility? </strong>Accessibility ensures all people have access to the things we create. It can’t be an afterthought or something for the web dev team to figure out. It must drive the entire creative process and serve as an anchor to ground our teams and our work.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Requirement vs. Challenge.</strong> Most creative projects work within a set of requirements. These don’t prohibit the creative process. Instead, they challenge us to enhance the things we build and make them better than we might have without thinking through and within these constraints.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>It’s All Around Us.</strong> We think of accessibility as a new idea, but in so many spaces, it’s the norm. We have curb cutouts and braille signage. We see this every day, so tech is catching up.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Improving Usability. Developing through the lens of accessibility means delivering experiences that solve people’s problems and help them with tasks.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>It Takes Tools.</strong> The creative and engineering are just rails. Utilizing tools to ensure accessibility when publishing and setting up processes and guidelines will equip you to flex as requirements change. It’s necessary for your organization to resource accessibility for it to be done effectively.</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\">\n\n</div>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"eplus-wrapper\" id=\"h-mentioned-in-the-show\"><img src=\"https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/14.0.0/72x72/1f517.png\" alt=\"🔗\" class=\"wp-smiley\" /> Mentioned in the show<strong>:</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://tri.be/\">Modern Tribe</a></li>\n\n\n\n<li><a href=\"https://vimeo.com/148927676\">Eric Meyer</a></li>\n\n\n\n<li><a href=\"https://myspace.com/\">MySpace</a></li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"eplus-wrapper\" id=\"h-you-can-follow-post-status-and-our-guests-on-twitter\"><img src=\"https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/14.0.0/72x72/1f426.png\" alt=\"🐦\" class=\"wp-smiley\" /> You can follow Post Status and our guests on Twitter:</h3>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"eplus-wrapper\">\n<li><a href=\"https://twitter.com/brandondove\"></a><a href=\"https://twitter.com/ChrisMKindred\">Chris Kindred</a> (Director of Backend Development, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/pixel_jar\"></a><a href=\"https://twitter.com/ModernTribeAgcy\">Modern Tribe</a>)</li>\n\n\n\n<li><a href=\"https://twitter.com/sarahgless\">Sarah Gless</a> (Creative Director, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/pixel_jar\"></a><a href=\"https://twitter.com/ModernTribeAgcy\">Modern Tribe</a>)</li>\n\n\n\n<li><a href=\"https://twitter.com/mjklanac\">Mike Klanac</a> (Director of Business Development, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/pixel_jar\"></a><a href=\"https://twitter.com/ModernTribeAgcy\">Modern Tribe</a>)</li>\n\n\n\n<li><a href=\"https://twitter.com/corymiller303\">Cory Miller</a> (CEO, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/post_status\">Post Status</a>)</li>\n\n\n\n<li><a href=\"https://twitter.com/lemonadecode\">Olivia Bisset</a> (Intern, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/post_status\">Post Status</a>)</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"eplus-wrapper has-background\">The <strong>Post Status Draft</strong> podcast is geared toward WordPress professionals, with interviews, news, and deep analysis. <img src=\"https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/14.0.0/72x72/1f4dd.png\" alt=\"📝\" class=\"wp-smiley\" /><br /><br /><a href=\"https://poststatus.com/category/post-status-podcasts/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Browse our archives</a>, and don’t forget to subscribe via <a href=\"https://itunes.apple.com/us/podcast/post-status-draft-wordpress/id976403008\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">iTunes</a>, <a href=\"https://podcasts.google.com/feed/aHR0cHM6Ly9mZWVkcy5zaW1wbGVjYXN0LmNvbS8ySkU5c2M4UA\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Google Podcasts</a>, <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/c/PostStatus\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">YouTube</a>, <a href=\"http://www.stitcher.com/podcast/krogsgard/post-status-draft-wordpress-podcast\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Stitcher</a>, <a href=\"https://wordpress-post-status-draft-podcast.simplecast.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Simplecast</a>, or <a href=\"https://feeds.simplecast.com/2JE9sc8P\">RSS</a>. <img src=\"https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/14.0.0/72x72/1f3a7.png\" alt=\"🎧\" class=\"wp-smiley\" /></p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"eplus-wrapper\" id=\"h-transcript\">Transcript</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Cory Miller: [00:00:00] Everybody welcome back to another Post Status Live. This is where we<br />do, uh, webinars and interviews with our awesome members at Post Status. And today we&#8217;ve<br />got a great talented team from Modern Tribe.<br />I&#8217;m gonna let them unpack a little bit more about what Modern Tribe does and what they do at<br />Modern Tribe. But today, our topic is gonna be the right approach to WordPress accessibility.<br />This kinda, this really came to the forefront for us and why I sought these experts out because<br />accessibility is a non-negotiable for the web.<br />Um, and they&#8217;re gonna talk more about their passion, their experiences, their expertise around<br />that. But I will just say this is a topic that we need to be talking about more, and we&#8217;re<br />specifically doing this webinar, and I&#8217;ve asked them to come on and share. Particular areas and<br />work inaccessibility with WordPress.<br />But if you&#8217;re a leader, you&#8217;re a developer, you&#8217;re a designer, um, starting to embark on a, on a<br />website project and want rightly so, to [00:01:00] make sure your website is accessible to all<br />people. This is, this is the extended webinar for you. We&#8217;re gonna talk, we&#8217;re gonna talk about a<br />lot. We&#8217;re gonna talk about how does a c-suite or leadership team properly resource and lead,<br />uh, in the accessibility projects for your organization, all the way down to the developers,<br />designers, the people that use the website every single day to make sure you&#8217;re doing your best<br />for those, trying to access your website.<br />So, I wanna introduce these te these, uh, this team today, but I&#8217;m gonna let you do that. So,<br />Mike, could you start us off and share, um, a little bit about what you do with, with, uh, uh, your<br />work at Modern Tribe and, uh, your interest in this whole topic of accessibility?<br />Mike Klanac: Yeah, thanks Corey. Um, my name is Mike Klan.<br />I am the Director of Business Development at Modern Tribe. Um, that&#8217;s essentially a sales role<br />here. [00:02:00] Um, and, uh, I&#8217;m really excited to talk more about accessibility. Um, I, you know,<br />to be transparent, I was actually a little nervous at first, uh, because of my role as essentially a<br />sales role. And, um, this is such an important topic and, and Corey in like preparing for this, you<br />said something that, that resonated with me, which is, , you know, if this is important, um, don&#8217;t<br />feel bad about being an advocate for it and talking about it.<br />Um, so, uh, that helped build my confidence. So I&#8217;m excited to be here to talk more especially<br />about, uh, accessibility as it relates to leadership and as it relates to a core value that stretches<br />across all components of your business. Uh, so, um, yeah, I think continue on with introductions<br />and maybe I could circle back and, and tell you a little bit more about, uh, tribe and how long<br />we&#8217;ve been around.<br />Cory Miller: Yeah. We&#8217;ll, we&#8217;ll come back to you, but I think you, you know, one compelling<br />reason you&#8217;re here too is because you do talk to people that are making decisions, [00:03:00]<br />but not necessarily always the people doing the work too. And it&#8217;s a collaborative approach. And<br />I know your heart, you&#8217;re super, super humble, but very experienced.<br />Mm-hmm. , um, professional. So I&#8217;m really glad to have you on here and you&#8217;re gonna talk first<br />as we, after we do introductions about the whole leadership angle for all of this. Um, Chris and<br />Sarah. Yeah,<br />Chris Kindred: thanks. Um, my name&#8217;s Chris Kendrick. I am, uh, director of backend, um,<br />engineering here at Modern Tribe. Um, I, accessibility&#8217;s always been a passion of mine, um, and<br />it&#8217;s been, uh, really great to come on board at somewhere like Modern Tribe, where they take<br />flexibility so seriously.<br />So, uh, that&#8217;s always been a, a great thing for, for me, um, moving forward. So,<br />yeah.<br />Sarah Gless: Hi, I&#8217;m Sarah Glass. Oh, sorry.<br />Cory Miller: Yeah, yeah. Sorry. Go ahead Sarah. Yeah, thanks Chris.<br />Sarah Gless: Yeah, thank you for having us. Um, I&#8217;m Sarah Glass. I&#8217;m the creative Director at<br />Modern [00:04:00] Tribe. Ultimately, that means I&#8217;m in service to both our clients, making sure<br />that we&#8217;re shipping incredibly beautiful and, and and engaging work, um, as well as our design</p>\n\n\n\n<p>team, ensuring that, you know, they&#8217;re fulfilled in and the work that they&#8217;re doing, and we&#8217;re<br />continuously developing and pushing the work forward.<br />Um, I&#8217;m super passionate about accessibility too. You know, I think that, as you know, coming<br />from a design background, um, ultimately I wanna communicate effectively with, with, with<br />people. And, um, if, if you cut off people in those lanes of communication, um, how good is that<br />design? So I, I truly believe that good design is accessible design.<br />Um, super excited to, to be here and, and chat more about.<br />Cory Miller: I can&#8217;t wait to dig in with all three of you because what you just said, Sarah, is good<br />access, good accessibility is good design. And I think there&#8217;s probably a lot of designers out<br />there that just kind of like, oh, okay, we can do this. So I&#8217;m looking forward to talking more about<br />that, particularly, um, I&#8217;m gonna hype &#8217;em up,<br />[00:05:00] Yeah, absolutely. This can be, you know, that&#8217;s another message in all this, this can<br />be done. There is an approach, a good approach to it, and it is possible, and I think that&#8217;s a<br />really great message. Um, so Mike, before we kind of get into the actual topics, could you tell us<br />a little bit more about Modern Tribe as an agency?<br />Mike Klanac: Sure, sure. I&#8217;ll give you the short version. So, um, Modern Tribe, we like to call<br />ourselves a full service digital design and development agency. Um, we&#8217;ve been around for<br />about 15 years now, uh, and recently joined the liquid web family of brands. Um, I think like one<br />of the way, another way we describe ourselves is we say we connect to the touchpoints of your<br />digital ecosystem.<br />Um, and when I say that, I think what&#8217;s important to note is kind of that WordPress is often. the<br />center, it&#8217;s the hub, the WordPress TMS is the hub of that ecosystem. So we lean on, on<br />WordPress heavily. [00:06:00] Um, and our, our business, I mean, it sort of breaks down into<br />four key categories. There&#8217;s strategy, there&#8217;s content, there&#8217;s design, there&#8217;s engineering, um,<br />and that&#8217;s sort of who we are.<br />Um, accessibility of the topic at hand today, uh, as you&#8217;ll see it, it sort of permeates all of those<br />areas and it&#8217;s sort of core to who we are, um, as an organization. So, um, yeah, we&#8217;re, we&#8217;re<br />press agency.<br />Cory Miller: And I know you all work with some name brand organizations. Maybe you can&#8217;t all<br />talk about it, but I&#8217;m aware enough to know that you all have worked with some of the biggest<br />brands that are household names, helping them specifically, not just with their web, but also that<br />this important part, accessibility.<br />And some of these, uh, organizations, Mike, particularly I know from talking with you all<br />background about this, is if you take federal funding in any way, particularly in the United States,<br />it, it&#8217;s not even a conversation about is it, is [00:07:00] it a thing we should do? It&#8217;s like, no, you<br />do it. And I think that amps us up even more.<br />Um, thankfully, government non-profits have led the way with accessibility, but this is something<br />we&#8217;ll talk more about. Everybody should be doing this. Um, this is this, we&#8217;re in 2023 now today.<br />And it, this is just a part and I&#8217;m, that&#8217;s why, another reason I&#8217;m glad, but you all work with these<br />organizations where you&#8217;re like, there&#8217;s a lot of scrutiny on these organizations you work with.<br />That means that that&#8217;s a good thing in a way because they have to make sure, like Sarah was<br />saying, that this website is successful for anyone that wants to, to access it. So, uh, I think that&#8217;s<br />pretty critical and also demonstrates why I asked Modern Tribe and U three to come on to talk<br />about this today.<br />So, okay, here&#8217;s the layout. We&#8217;re gonna talk about leadership. Now for those of you watching<br />and listening, um, we&#8217;re gonna each, each of the experts, I&#8217;ve asked to talk about a specific area<br />related to their expertise, but you&#8217;re gonna hear from them. I&#8217;ve told them, I said, [00:08:00] I<br />don&#8217;t want you to stay silent.<br />Mike&#8217;s part part, I want you to contribute too, because. As we&#8217;ve talked and prepared for this, it&#8217;s<br />helped me understand this is a holistic process that everybody in the organization needs to<br />embrace. And so, again, I&#8217;ll, I&#8217;ll just say to y&#8217;all, please, if Mike&#8217;s talking, share something from<br />your perspective about this, uh, please do that.<br />Cause I think this is gonna help people. Our intention here is you&#8217;re trying to do right and good<br />by this for your website project. So I want you all to like, help them really understand these are<br />the things we work with clients about. These are the problems we see, these are the challenges<br />we see and here&#8217;s our thoughts.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Because you, you are experts in this and you see things that I think could make those trying to<br />cross this threshold, um, truly be prepared for and make really good decisions that helps<br />everybody involved, even if they don&#8217;t choose modern tribe as the agency. So again, I think<br />that&#8217;s right on important.<br />Okay, so let&#8217;s just start right here, because [00:09:00] oftentimes, as I understand this, both<br />leading my own organizations, listening to you all and other agency members that post status, I<br />go, um, this type of decision needs to start at the, you know, the top of the hierarchy here. If the<br />leaders aren&#8217;t on board or don&#8217;t fully understand it, this is gonna be a problem.<br />So, I hope those leaders listening, this is your time to take notes because Mike, I, I want you to<br />kind of, what do you think of when you&#8217;re saying, okay, I am, let&#8217;s say a c e O of an organization<br />or in the C-suite or leadership team. I need to start helping think through this, you know,<br />accessibility for what we do on the web.<br />What stands out to you when we talked about leadership and WordPress accessibility.<br />Mike Klanac: Yeah, I&#8217;m, I&#8217;m so glad we get to talk about it from this perspective, because so<br />often accessibility can get pretty dense and technical right away. Um, but in today&#8217;s modern<br />world, uh, it it&#8217;s more than that. And it&#8217;s something that permeates all aspects of your business if<br />you [00:10:00] want it to be successful.<br />And therefore, it often has to start with leadership, um, realizing why it&#8217;s, IM important. Um, it&#8217;s,<br />it&#8217;s gotta be built as a core consideration, um, to all of those various layers. Uh, and the best<br />organizations, the really effective organizations that care and are considerate of their users<br />make this a, a core value.<br />It&#8217;s, it literally becomes, um, part of the culture. Top to bottom. Um, so I think one of the ways to<br />build that understanding is to really think about like, why you&#8217;re doing this. And we hit on the<br />legal implications initially, and I think that&#8217;s where a lot of people first start thinking about this for<br />some reason.<br />But you kind of need to back up and really remember that one of the first reasons this is<br />important is, is just morally, it&#8217;s, it&#8217;s morally important. It&#8217;s a part of digital inclusivity. We are<br />creating tools that serve [00:11:00] users, that serve people, and therefore we need to care for<br />them. We need to think about how they use it.<br />And that applies to all of the users. It&#8217;s an increasingly competitive world. We don&#8217;t have the<br />luxury of, um, excluding people because it&#8217;s not convenient to, um, build tools that serve them<br />effectively. So I think like we really need to ground ourselves in the moral component of this first,<br />which is it&#8217;s the right thing to do.<br />It&#8217;s just the right thing to do, therefore needs to be a leadership initiative. It needs to be brought<br />in, carried through to all components, all layers of your business. Okay. So that&#8217;s like the first<br />thing that I would probably tell a leader in this space is that make it a part of all of your thinking.<br />Cory Miller: I mean, you know, I, we were talking about a client used to consult with before we<br />started recording and I was like, you could tell there the client one did the traditional thing, print<br />off your core values, put it on all the doors, and you&#8217;re like, cool. Yeah. But what are your real<br />core values? [00:12:00] And it seems to me, as you talk about one, there is a business reason<br />to do this, very legitimate that it&#8217;s gonna get a lot of people&#8217;s attention.<br />But I think what you were, you&#8217;re saying is like it should reflect a value that you might not have<br />on the door, but like we care. Yes, we care about the whole population and being able to get to<br />the things that we offer. And if we don&#8217;t, it it, I mean that rings really true when you say that<br />business, there&#8217;s a legitimate business reason and that should hopefully check most boxes.<br />But I think the other thing is that you should actually just care. Yeah. We&#8217;ve all probably been<br />touched in some way with someone that has, uh, uh, uh, something that doesn&#8217;t allow them to<br />see, read, hear, whatever that is, um, that we need to be thinking about that. Just because we<br />don&#8217;t have that particular issue doesn&#8217;t mean there&#8217;s a pretty significant one is a significant<br />enough to me.<br />But I mean this, we&#8217;re talking about in this accessibility [00:13:00] conversation quite a bit of the<br />population that most organizations have flatly not even thought about till today.<br />Mike Klanac: Exactly. Yeah, I think it just sends the right message. You know, when you&#8217;re the<br />type of organization that takes the time to be deliberate and considerate of all of your users,<br />there&#8217;s probably an understanding that that carries through to your product.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you&#8217;re selling something, um, you, your service, your, your organization as a whole. So, um,<br />it&#8217;s just the right thing to do. And I think, I think we should just start there as it&#8217;s, it&#8217;s morally right.<br />And as you hit on, um, and to segue a little bit, there are legitimate business reasons. So, um,<br />making sure that your, your site is fully accessible, has this effect of improving the quality, the<br />experience for your users.<br />And that sort of in some ways overlays these other topics that we often talk about as like key<br />performance indicators for businesses. [00:14:00] Things like search engine optimization, um,<br />core web vitals. Um, these are adjacent to each other. So it it&#8217;s about creating an experience<br />that is a user experience that&#8217;s quality for everyone, and therefore your, your business will feel<br />that it&#8217;ll have an impact.<br />Um, so not only is it the right thing to do, morally a highly accessible site that&#8217;s gonna benefit<br />your, your clicks, your conversions, and all those things that we&#8217;ve spent so much time thinking<br />about, um, and that we&#8217;re starting to, to kind of like land a couple of really important reasons. It&#8217;s<br />like, you know, it&#8217;s what&#8217;s good as a person, it&#8217;s what&#8217;s good for business.<br />Um, it th those alone are, are enough reason, right, to really think long and hard about this. Um,<br />But there&#8217;s this final one too, which is the one we kind of backed into this from, which was,<br />there&#8217;s some legal requirements here. I I, I pulled a stat, and I think everyone&#8217;s aware of this,<br />but, [00:15:00] um, 2,800 accessibility lawsuits in 2021.<br />Um, that&#8217;s, that&#8217;s like, it&#8217;s a big deal. And those lawsuits, um, are meaningful and there&#8217;s a place<br />for them. Um, but more important than the litigation itself is you just have an opportunity to get<br />ahead of this if you do things right, and that can get confusing. Um, I, sorry, you&#8217;re gonna jump<br />in. I&#8217;ll take a beat.<br />Cory Miller: Yeah, no, I, I think, um, I&#8217;m curious to hear what Chris and Sarah think too,<br />because it&#8217;s like, you know, we&#8217;ve all been to those situations, uh, where you&#8217;re like, the<br />organization talks a really good talk. Yeah. You know, and we&#8217;ve got plenty of those in our<br />society globally today. But you know, the ones that talk.<br />And you know that ones that just act on that value. And I think this shines pretty clearly whether<br />you go to a website, you see the accessibility blue circle or whatever this is. And I think<br />[00:16:00] this is an opportunity. I&#8217;m curious what Chris and Sarah think too from just an<br />organization standpoint of like when you see someone taking it to this degree, not because they<br />necessarily have to, a lot of these have to, but, and there&#8217;s a probably legitimate reason why<br />there&#8217;s regulations and laws and different things in these lawsuits is because like, okay, if you&#8217;re<br />not gonna do the right thing, the, the world society will kind of push you in that regard.<br />But I think, I&#8217;m curious what you think Chris and Sarah is like, this is a way to get out front and<br />lead act on those values. You can&#8217;t just say you care, but if you care enough to make sure your<br />website is A to B, everybody can can access that and and consume the information and<br />whatever you&#8217;re trying to offer in the world, that&#8217;s an opportunity for leadership to me.<br />So Sarah, Chris, what do you think? . I, yeah,<br />Chris Kindred: I, uh, okay. Uh, I, I think there&#8217;s a huge opportunity there. One of the things we<br />tend to hear is, well, that&#8217;s not the kind of person we&#8217;re marketing to. And [00:17:00] you know,<br />there&#8217;s, there&#8217;s so much more than that going on with accessibility. It&#8217;s, you know, you may not<br />be marketing to &#8217;em right now, but who knows what&#8217;s going to happen in the future.<br />They, they, uh, or, or, um, friends that they have that, that kind of thing, they can help, um, push<br />along whatever product you&#8217;re pushing. And in those cases, so, you know, you&#8217;ve got, um,<br />you&#8217;ve got companies that come at it from that angle and, and there&#8217;s a little bit of education that<br />we have to do to help kind of get &#8217;em over that hump of this.<br />This is, this is a moral thing as well, . It&#8217;s, it&#8217;s not who you&#8217;re marketing to. It is that you are<br />marketing to everybody. Everyone&#8217;s going to see it, and it&#8217;s important that everybody be able to<br />see it.<br />Sarah Gless: Yeah, and I think that, like, going back to Mike&#8217;s original point, like it takes the<br />organization to do that.<br />It cannot be on the shoulders of like your web team. Um, yes, they are like [00:18:00] hands-on<br />producing and shipping that thing. Um, but that thing should be symbolic of like a much larger,<br />um, um, effort around accessibility. Um, and, and your kind of example around, you know,<br />posting your, your core values as a, as a company on the wall, um, and accessibility or<br />inclusivity being on that, um, kind of made me start to think like, what&#8217;s like a real example of, of<br />this.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Um, you know, like I, I. And transferring that responsibility, not transferring, but sharing that<br />responsibility across the organization means you have to figure out, like, how can each<br />department take part in that? Um, how can we better collaborate on that mission? Um, I think,<br />you know, I&#8217;ve spent a lot of times on and, and working with like brand and marketing teams,<br />great opportunity for, for, for people to get involved in accessibility that may not be, um, on the<br />line to like ship that, that website necessarily.<br />Um, for example, we mentioned, you know, calling out your brand [00:19:00] values. Maybe<br />you&#8217;ve got, you know, being inclusive as, as, as a brand value. Well back that up with like, you<br />know, shipping accessible designs on the marketing side. So like, if you&#8217;re working on a brand<br />book, um, A big part of that is establishing a color palette.<br />Um, and that color palette has implications across so much of your collateral across the<br />organization, including that website. Now, oftentimes what happens on like design, um, is that<br />we&#8217;re handed a brand book with colors we can&#8217;t use, and now we&#8217;re having to rework that<br />because accessibility was never consideration going into that.<br />Um, so that&#8217;s like a, a various, you know, tech like tactile example of, of how one little shift, you<br />know, like, and if your team doesn&#8217;t have the specialties to do that, that&#8217;s okay. Like lean on a<br />team of experts to help and collaborate on that. So bring in the web team into, you know, that<br />brand conversation and when you&#8217;re developing that color palette or, or whatever the thing is,<br />um, to get their [00:20:00] expertise and, and, and make sure that we&#8217;re living up to that kind of,<br />you know, core tenant of being inclusive and accessible.<br />And also, um, Beyond just being like the right thing to do. Like, you know, if you do work ahead,<br />the more you work ahead on accessibility, the more money you&#8217;ll save down the road, um,<br />because you don&#8217;t have to rework as much. So, um, definitely another, you know, kind of<br />business, um, opportunity.<br />Cory Miller: And I, I think, thanks for that.<br />Oh, Chris, go ahead.<br />Chris Kindred: Well, that, that just made me start thinking, um, one of the things is accessibility<br />doesn&#8217;t just stop with your digital things. Um, I, there&#8217;s, there&#8217;s a billboard I drive past or used to<br />drive past all the time, and I could barely read it because it was blue on blue and it just didn&#8217;t,<br />didn&#8217;t work well for, for me as I was driving a car 60 miles an hour past it.<br />I, I, if you&#8217;re going. Put that your, uh, that accessibility and, [00:21:00] and being inclusive as<br />part of your core values that trickles into your billboard, that trickles into the entryway to your<br />business, that that trickles into so many other things in order to prove it.<br />Sarah Gless: It&#8217;s a mind shift, isn&#8217;t it? Like when you, when you Yeah, when and, but it, but<br />once you start doing and getting the practice of that and resource for it, that&#8217;s a critical part of<br />this, right?<br />Um, you, it will become a habit. And, and that&#8217;s a good habit to have.<br />Cory Miller: And I keep shaping this mike in my mind as it&#8217;s a, it&#8217;s a problem, but if we can do it,<br />you just said Sarah and shift her mind, we go, this is an opportunity to show people we care. We<br />don&#8217;t have to put the word on there. If we do certain things like this, just like we&#8217;ve mentioned,<br />diversity, equity, inclusion, huge topic and rightly.<br />This is going, if we truly want to act on that, we need to think about that person who might be<br />blind and trying to ex, like you were talking about, you know, the color palettes and things. It&#8217;s to<br />that thought. [00:22:00] But Mike, it seems like too, I think Chris and Boer helped me today.<br />Like, let&#8217;s add another reason here.<br />This is a team Mork, Hey, we care. So we&#8217;re doing this accessibility project and, and other<br />initiatives in the business side of things that they can do to say, we&#8217;re not just gonna say it, we&#8217;re<br />gonna do it. I mean, this seems like when you go to your team, like Sarah was saying, and<br />you&#8217;re like, Hey, leadership has bought in on this and understands it.<br />Now we go to the team, we want, hey, we want everyone as best we can to do, to, to be able to<br />access things.<br />Mike Klanac: It&#8217;s a, it&#8217;s a foundational, um, shift in how you think about it. So a small example<br />would be we used to, um, ask, do you need your site to be accessible? And now we just<br />assume we&#8217;re gonna build accessible sites.<br />And we used to take a pass at estimating a project and then sort of like do some additional math<br />to calculate accessibility. Now we assume accessibility is a part of every estimate that [00:23:00]</p>\n\n\n\n<p>you&#8217;re doing. Every line item of the feature level estimate incorporates accessibility thinking.<br />Um, and that&#8217;s, and that&#8217;s, that changes the approach.<br />It, it&#8217;s, it starts at the beginning. It carries through all the way to the end. And I, I think I would be<br />remiss not to mention one other topic on leadership that this conversation is sort of remind me<br />of, which is that these standards we&#8217;re talking accessibility is sort of this like, like just just this<br />open-ended term, but it, it means probably slightly different things.<br />And from a leadership standpoint, I think one other thing you need to really consider is what<br />standard are you, in some cases mandated to hit? And just understanding that is part of the<br />leadership obligation because you are the person that may often understand where you&#8217;re doing<br />business, what your jurisdictions are, um, what, what laws you&#8217;re bound to.<br />And if you&#8217;re as an international organization, we, we work with groups in Europe, we work with<br />groups [00:24:00] in California. We, we work with groups that have different sets of<br />requirements and different guidelines. So I think an important note for anyone who&#8217;s, who&#8217;s<br />gonna try to build this philosophy into their organization as they should, uh, is to, to like really<br />fundamentally set some clear guidelines to your team and say that based on where we do<br />business and where we&#8217;re approaching it, the way we&#8217;re approaching it, we&#8217;re gonna try to hit,<br />you know, stay tuned to section 5 0 8.<br />Um, And, and the, the outlines set in WIC AG two one, aa. Like we, there needs to be some<br />basis for what you&#8217;re aiming towards. Uh, it doesn&#8217;t, doesn&#8217;t mean that, um, you can&#8217;t go past<br />that. Um, but uh, you probably need to have that guiding light.<br />Cory Miller: Uh, and I think there&#8217;s a relief for me talking to you all on this too, because when I<br />know for instance, this is a value, right?<br />That we want to, that I love you, you said, uh, just it&#8217;s assumed. You know, [00:25:00] we&#8217;re in<br />2023 having this conversation. It doesn&#8217;t matter what&#8217;s been in the past today, this is just an<br />assumption that mind shift shift, um, but that it occurs to me, you know, as a leader and then<br />we&#8217;ve all kind of talked this and know this, we can&#8217;t know every single thing.<br />Like you&#8217;re talking about these specific legislation, policies, regulations out there. You can&#8217;t<br />possibly. So, but I wanna say there&#8217;s hope. That&#8217;s why we&#8217;re having this conversation. That&#8217;s<br />why there&#8217;s great experts in WordPress overall. Try being one of them that, um, can help<br />navigate some of those. Like it doesn&#8217;t need to be the, the thing that you keep up with at the<br />absolute.<br />That&#8217;s why you hire people like you all to even mention some of these things. Like I&#8217;ve been in<br />tech a long time and I learned something when I&#8217;m talking about when to you all about these<br />things that I hadn&#8217;t considered. And I think that&#8217;s a maybe a sense. Is like, there&#8217;s a little bit of<br />relief you can say like you want to do the right thing.<br />That&#8217;s why you go seek out experts that do. That&#8217;s why I&#8217;ve enjoyed preparation about this. I&#8217;ve<br />learned [00:26:00] a ton that I wouldn&#8217;t even considered . Like Sarah, you were talking about the<br />brand and I go more design Chris than tech sometimes, cuz I don&#8217;t know what I&#8217;m talking about<br />with tech all the time. But I go take this thought and go to your brand values.<br />We have oranges ours, but I have no idea how that expresses itself necessarily. Right. Uh, on<br />the web for someone that&#8217;s hurt and that&#8217;s a holistic thinking. We&#8217;re thinking like we, we&#8217;ve hit<br />this do do good and it&#8217;s got a pretty dang good benefit because it&#8217;s like absolutely. You can<br />actually reflect and show what you&#8217;re doing.<br />So.<br />Sarah Gless: Absolutely. Um, yeah. And you mentioned like. Kind of like leaning on on experts.<br />And that ki kind of got me thinking, like, I think there&#8217;s this expectation. Um, I know design<br />designers put this expectation on them to, to, um, sometimes to, to be able to like have<br />expertise in this. And like we absolutely have to have, you know, baseline knowledge and, and<br />skills that apply to [00:27:00] our work to meet accessibility.<br />But, um, you know, as an organization, if you&#8217;re in a marketing team, um, for example, and<br />you&#8217;re like, do I, do I need to know everything about accessibility? No. And there&#8217;s no, I mean,<br />accessibility is a, you know, a full team of effort. Um, yeah. Um, at Modern Tribe, we&#8217;ve got a full<br />dedicated QA team that is testing rigorously everything we design and build.<br />Um, so, so no. But can you get to a place where you&#8217;ve got like a good baseline knowledge of<br />accessibility and or also like resources that you know you can turn to, whether it be, um, your<br />own team internally that&#8217;s focused on accessibility, your leadership has resource for awesome.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Or, um, if you can work with consultants or agencies like us or, or what whoever, um, get that,<br />that resource embedded in your team so you can turn to them, um, for their expertise.<br />Because [00:28:00] accessibility is like this ever-changing thing that will continue to grow. Um,<br />and, and I just wanna, like, I think that&#8217;s something like in my own past, I put that pressure on<br />myself and, um mm-hmm. , it&#8217;s a lot of pressure and it can, can kind of, um, um, get you away<br />from other, you know, priorities within your role.<br />So acknowledge that you do not have to, um, necessarily be experts, inaccessibility, but you do<br />have like a moral and business responsibility. To care about it and get help when you need it.<br />Um, um, so yeah,<br />Cory Miller: I think, I think that&#8217;s, that, that&#8217;s a great point. Um, in, in all this. Um, and now we&#8217;re<br />gonna shift to you in just a moment to talk specifically about design, Sarah.<br />But Mike, before we do that, I just wanna make sure, I think we&#8217;ve hit really big pillars here. Um,<br />moral business requirements, , it can be, there&#8217;s an opportunity here to lead and show that you<br />truly care. Um, anything else you think about when you&#8217;re, when you&#8217;re thinking about leaders<br />[00:29:00] making these decisions, wanting to give those resources to design and team and<br />things like that, anything else that we missed that you wanna share?<br />Mike Klanac: Just to like summarize, it&#8217;s a tremendous opportunity. It went from being, uh, a<br />challenge, a problem to No, this is just an opportunity to better serve our, our audience. Um, and<br />that&#8217;s how I would be thinking about it.<br />Cory Miller: Yeah, what a great mind shift and what a great takeaway we have more. So if<br />you&#8217;re a leader in an, an organization making these decisions, stay on because there&#8217;s more,<br />because this is a, we&#8217;re we&#8217;re evolving and growing this concept, like we&#8217;ve been saying as a<br />mind shift, shift change over.<br />What a great, great way to sum up that, Mike. Thank you. Okay, so Sarah, now let&#8217;s just talk<br />creative and design, because a part of this, I&#8217;ll just say this, I was like, okay, I can get the<br />decision. Like I can really embody that and go, it&#8217;s, it&#8217;ll take time, it will take effort, it will take<br />money. But as we&#8217;re talking, I go, [00:30:00] gosh, I&#8217;ve been in the seat too, where you&#8217;re a<br />marketing person or you&#8217;re trying to ship the work into, through the website and there&#8217;s<br />decisions and things that you need to be thinking about that.<br />So as we talk about in this role, creative and design, what, what things stick out to you as we<br />approach the accessibility topic?<br />Sarah Gless: Yeah, absolutely. Well, um, I think just acknowledging that it is a requirement. Um,<br />I think that there&#8217;s this kind of stigma that accessible design, um, pro, you know, prohibits<br />creativity, um, in a way that, you know, accessibly designed websites.<br />Are ugly , for lack of a better term. Um, and I think that that stems from, you know, a history of,<br />of hearing about lawsuits and, and, and building requirements around certain sectors. Um,<br />particularly like the government. Um, and websites for governments or government, um,<br />institutions are, are, are typically not known for, [00:31:00] um, their design.<br />There are a few, of course . Um, so it&#8217;s, it, you know, accessibility, I think in the design world has<br />a, a, a reputation that it&#8217;s gonna restrict me. Um, and I don&#8217;t like to think about that like that. I, I, I<br />want, you know, our design team, we, we sh we, we have a mindset that it&#8217;s just an a<br />requirement and any creative brief you get, um, I&#8217;m sorry, but it&#8217;s gonna have requirements on it.<br />Um, and so if you think about that and shift your mind into thinking that way, it truly does<br />become a creative opportunity, um, and a creative challenge. And, um, I think designers and<br />creatives. Tend to work very well if you give them some structure, but then opportunities to<br />innovate and there&#8217;s tons of opportunities to do that with accessibility.<br />Um, I think of like a past project we worked on for, um, oh, very well known, uh, Ivy League, uh,<br />school, um, that, you know, we designed a, a navigation, it was very robust, it [00:32:00] was<br />very, um, uh, boundary pushing, I&#8217;ll say on the design side. And at first blush, it did not look like<br />it was going to meet accessibility.<br />Um, we worked and collaborated with our QA team, our engineering team, um, and within those<br />boundaries of accessibility and or those requirements, um, and looking at this thing that we<br />really wanted to like put live into the world, we figured it out. Um, and we shipped a very<br />accessible, um, site and navigation that ended up winning a design award like.<br />You can do it. It&#8217;s totally possible. Does it take more resources and time? Yes, but it&#8217;s like po you<br />know? Yes. Um, there&#8217;s, there&#8217;s no way around that, but yes. Um, but you, it, it&#8217;s, it, it truly can</p>\n\n\n\n<p>actually lead to like innovative ideas because, um, even within those requirements, there&#8217;s,<br />there&#8217;s bars to push and like, uh, [00:33:00] uh, figure out how to, to, um, uh, make this work.<br />Cory Miller: So, yeah, I think what you&#8217;re saying, so I fancy myself sometimes justified or not as<br />a creative, and what I hear when you say that is, I know there&#8217;s a bunch of people, when you<br />said the first part feels like it could prohibit, they&#8217;re probably like, yeah, it feels that way. But then<br />you spun it around and you said, this is an opportunity here.<br />I I, when I fancy myself as a creative, I go, constraints are actually really good in a lot of cases.<br />And so if, if it&#8217;s a challenge, Hey, you&#8217;ve give, you&#8217;re given these tools. Take it and be creative.<br />Like that&#8217;s what I got from that example you just gave is like, we looked at it potentially as an<br />obstacle, but we turned it into an opportunity to be really creative and make it work.<br />And I think that&#8217;s part of like, I&#8217;ll get a little fur here and say artistic, like when you say you&#8217;re<br />creative, it means like, don&#8217;t look at these as problems. [00:34:00] Look at &#8217;em as opportunities.<br />You know, that&#8217;s the thing we got with leadership. It seems like. That&#8217;s what I just, I wrote it<br />down. I was like, we&#8217;re talking about how this challenge can be viewed as an opportunity and for<br />creatives, having worked with some creatives, I&#8217;m like, Hey, see what you can do.<br />Yeah. The best things. See what you, yeah.<br />See what you can get away with. , ,<br />Sarah Gless: no, little rebellious ,<br />Mike Klanac: as a definite not creative. I, I really think this is an interesting part of the<br />conversation and somewhere out there, well, this is the part that I can add, I can add that there&#8217;s<br />an article about like Jack White and the White Stripes.<br />There&#8217;s this like idea of threes where they stay within three colors, three instruments, and that<br />that parameter within that, they try to push innovation as much as possible, and clearly they&#8217;ve<br />been successful with it, so.<br />Sarah Gless: Absolutely. That&#8217;s awesome. I, and you know, like, oh, go ahead Chris.<br />Chris Kindred: I, I feel like there&#8217;s another aspect specifically to the, the, um, menu that you&#8217;re,<br />that you&#8217;re talking about there [00:35:00] as a technical team.<br />When we look at a menu that came in like that, we&#8217;re, we&#8217;re looking at it going, now there&#8217;s the,<br />this is gonna be difficult, .<br />And the, the amazing part is though, . It just takes some communication. It takes the team<br />working together to figure out, okay, here&#8217;s where we can push a boundary. We, we, great point.<br />We know how to handle this piece. And we get that developed. We, we work with, you know,<br />our, our, our front end team does an amazing job at staying up to date with things like WIC ag<br />and, and we can really lean on them in, in some of these cases to say, okay, here&#8217;s how you can<br />accomplish this in an accessible way.<br />And then with com, with good communication between design and, and our, our engineering<br />team, we can, we can keep pushing those boundaries. Uh, you, you mentioned that it costs<br />more, it does cost more to be innovative [00:36:00] like that. That&#8217;s just part of being on the front<br />end of the curve. Right? If, if you are trying to push boundaries, it&#8217;s going to cost more.<br />but accessibility doesn&#8217;t have to cost more either. The innovation piece of it is what&#8217;s costing<br />more. Mm-hmm. . So, you know, if, if you&#8217;re, if you&#8217;re wanting to, to do a big award-winning nav,<br />heck yeah, let&#8217;s do it. Let&#8217;s jump in, let&#8217;s, let&#8217;s do it together. Uh, but it doesn&#8217;t have to be that<br />way to be accessible either, right?<br />Mm-hmm. . So, yeah.<br />Sarah Gless: Yeah. That multidisciplinary kind of approach is so critical. Um, I think it requires<br />both specialization and, uh, willingness, like multidisciplinary collaboration across teams to, to<br />do it. Right.<br />Cory Miller: Well, and we talked a lot about boundaries, pushing boundaries, and it seems to<br />me too, it&#8217;s like there&#8217;s probably some mental boundaries we put ourselves in if we think about it<br />as just, oh, this is a [00:37:00] problem and I don&#8217;t want to do it.<br />But I think what I hear from you too, Sarah, is like, Well, this, the, the regulations, the policies,<br />the things that govern this have actually created your canvas. You know, if we look at it like that<br />and we go Exactly. And then I love the challenge actually, like Chris going like, well, what can<br />cools, like even cross teams, we got a challenge, but let&#8217;s look at it as this opportunity to do<br />something really cool.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Like when you said the awards and stuff, like love that you&#8217;re like, do such a good job with this<br />challenge. They, you could actually win hearts and awards, you know? Exactly. And I think that&#8217;s<br />for creative people, I think that&#8217;s gotta be a stoking fire of like motivation. Oh, absolutely. An<br />inspiration.<br />Sarah Gless: Yeah.<br />So that, like, nav wins an award ranks high on accessible websites in higher ed. Like what? I<br />mean, that&#8217;s just a perfect pair<br />Cory Miller: and that person out there trying to look, trying to do see here whatever to that<br />[00:38:00] information. They&#8217;ve, they&#8217;ve had these experts. Giving their creative talent to do it.<br />So there&#8217;s that other part of like, somebody got to make sure they didn&#8217;t miss that part of the<br />website or whatever was happening in the project.<br />So exactly like, how many wins do we need? People, , , you know, like, and Chris, you&#8217;re gonna<br />get your chance to talk tech too. Um, but I really, I really love this, like the words I hear from you,<br />Sarah, particularly as designer, you know, artistic and creative. You go, you said, doesn&#8217;t have<br />to restrict, doesn&#8217;t have to pro prohibit anything, can actually blossom and grow your creativity.<br />If you, if you look again, we&#8217;re talking about mind shifts and we say, Hey, this is just the canvas I<br />get to create on. I love that. So what else comes to your mind when we talk, when you&#8217;re talking<br />to creative teams and people really trying to make sure the experience is great? What are the<br />things that pop up to you as you&#8217;ve worked with clients and, and the teams?<br />Sarah Gless: Yeah. Yeah. I, I think, uh, I mentioned this a little bit earlier, [00:39:00] but just.<br />Taking the, knowing that you don&#8217;t have to be an expert at this thing. Like, and really, again, I<br />can&#8217;t hit home enough, like collaborating and, and building kind of an extension of your team to<br />support accessibility is so critical. Um, and putting resources towards that.<br />Um, whether that&#8217;s in-house or, or with an agency. Um, you know, I look at our own design team<br />as a great example. Like we, we definitely stay up on knowledge as it affects, you know, the, the<br />work that we&#8217;re working on. Um, but even our team who is talking about accessibility all the<br />time, We still ha have experts specifically dedicated to accessibility within our organization, our<br />QA team, who we can collaborate and lean on to ensure that the work that we are designing<br />and putting out into the world is tru truly accessible.<br />And so I, I just wanna really hit home like if you, if [00:40:00] you, um, are feeling maybe a little<br />overwhelmed, like, how do, how do I do this? Lean on people who know how to do it. Um, and<br />um, yeah,<br />Cory Miller: I think you all have modeled that for me in our discussions leading up to this. You<br />really have modeled it. We, I won&#8217;t get into the exact details, but when I was saying, Hey, we&#8217;re<br />gonna, okay, we got our date and all that, you all started asking these questions.<br />I didn&#8217;t think about that. And they were accessibility questions like naturally. But what I really,<br />really appreciated about you three, why we&#8217;re like working with really super talented people that<br />are also humble is you all team approached that I think Sarah, you&#8217;re like, okay, I think, I think<br />it&#8217;s this, but let me, I&#8217;m gonna go, I&#8217;m gonna go chase that with a team.<br />Chris, same way. And you guys were collaborating and I think what you all have modeled, what<br />you&#8217;re talking about the client should do is really look at this like it&#8217;s not on one particular person.<br />Yeah. Embrace the team concept. [00:41:00] We, we care. And that&#8217;s why as a team, we&#8217;re<br />gonna figure this out together.<br />Mike Klanac: Yeah. Yeah. It&#8217;s a, a perpetually changing topic. It&#8217;s guidelines are evolving,<br />browsers are evolving. The tools that people use are always changing. So if you&#8217;re an expert<br />one day, by the next day, you have more learning to do. And the way that we get around that is<br />by leaning on each other as a team, uh, and thinking about it as sort of a topic that we all need<br />to stay fresh on, um,<br />Cory Miller: and just care about.<br />I mean, this whole conversation evolved because you and I were talking to Mike, you know, and<br />I&#8217;m aware of the work you all do, and. You know, through us talking, you go, gotta have Chris,<br />gotta have Sarah on this call. That&#8217;s my, that&#8217;s You have a bigger team. Absolutely. You all have<br />a bigger team of course.<br />But you&#8217;re like, that&#8217;s a great model. So like we had you start with leadership in making those<br />decisions and then we&#8217;re gonna talk about creativity and then we&#8217;re gonna talk about tech. And<br />then you all have even lighten. Say there&#8217;s somebody else that [00:42:00] might not be in that<br />spec, but they&#8217;re the ones publishing the post or whatever it is to the site.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Exactly. Yeah. I think we&#8217;ve modeled this like cross-disciplinary, I think you said that too, Sarah<br />is like, okay, we, when we&#8217;re having these conversations, we do need leadership, do need tech,<br />we do need design. And probably the people actually doing this, the work, like into the world,<br />probably all need to be somehow represented in that conversation.<br />So I think I&#8217;m, I&#8217;m digressing from your subject, Sarah, but I just go, I think that just, again,<br />models, it&#8217;s a holistic whole team approach. We&#8217;re, we&#8217;re not gonna get it perfect, but we&#8217;re<br />gonna figure it out together. Absolutely. So I I love that too. I think you&#8217;ve given permission to<br />take some burden off Sarah, as like, yes.<br />You don&#8217;t have to be aid<br />Sarah Gless: as long as you lean on, on, on your, your internal teams or consultants in that, in<br />that area<br />Cory Miller: Care. Lean on your team. Yes. Try to make the best decisions, get the best<br />[00:43:00] experience. You may not win the award every single time, but hey, allowing someone<br />to do that, which probably has a fr I can&#8217;t imagine the frustration someone might feel trying to<br />get actually this cool tool called the internet, but Oh, tripped up like one of the best<br />communication tools ever invented in human history, yet there&#8217;s significant part of our population<br />that can&#8217;t get to it.<br />Sarah Gless: Yeah. It&#8217;s like in the states, one in four, um, have a disability and I think globally<br />it&#8217;s one in six. Like think about those numbers. It&#8217;s like 25% in the us.<br />Cory Miller: That can&#8217;t,<br />Sarah Gless: that you may not be communicating with today on your website.<br />Cory Miller: I, uh, see again, you just go like, so let&#8217;s, let&#8217;s make this for a second, Mike.<br />I&#8217;m curious about this, but you two chime in. You go. If we were gonna say like, just make it a<br />business decision. If I went to any corporate leader, business leader in America and said, what if<br />you could get [00:44:00] 20% more than your gi, like, what if you could tap this market, Mike,<br />like from a market size, what if just from a business, okay, let&#8217;s take, take the pure human<br />element and you go, everybody, every business is looking for new markets to build and expand<br />on.<br />And you go the stat that&#8217;s you just shared, Sarah goes 20% of the popul. That, that, that if we<br />just embrace this right thing to do thing, you can get access to that. And imagine just from a<br />pure business standpoint, that market that&#8217;s served better than any they get anywhere else.<br />They&#8217;re gonna talk, they&#8217;re gonna share, do business here, do work here, because they&#8217;re<br />gonna be your most vocal evangelists.<br />So Mike, like from a pure business standpoint, and I go, let&#8217;s add it to the thing cuz this STA is<br />like we all think about the new markets that we could try to break into, you know, or grow our<br />existing thing. And you all just said, by the way, everybody ha you know, has a hard time with<br />this subject, but we&#8217;re giving you a [00:45:00] huge part of the population.<br />You could serve extremely well.<br />Mike Klanac: Again, yes. Massive opportunity. And, you know, we have so many conversations<br />where, where we will, um, sit and deliberate over customer journeys or you know, how to adjust<br />content in a way to gain just that slight advantage, that percentage change, that 1%, 2% change<br />in conversion or experience improvement.<br />And here&#8217;s an opportunity if you really think about it, to cater to a, you know, one in four people<br />in the United States. That&#8217;s a dramatic improvement. And, and that alone justifies, you know,<br />thinking about this start to finish. It&#8217;s just an incredible opportunity. Again, uh, it&#8217;s a no-brainer.<br />Cory Miller: I&#8217;ve told you all, I want Modern Tribe to do some stickers around these things that<br />I&#8217;ve heard as like core values should be accessibility.<br />Yeah. But it&#8217;s also like, Hey, uh, I got a secret. Do you wanna grow your business? Do the right<br />thing? Like, [00:46:00] just service me on the shirt. . Yeah. Get it on the shirt. Cause I need a<br />shirt for that. You know, I&#8217;m a, I&#8217;m a swag geek Mike. But anyway, I digress. . No, we&#8217;re too, it&#8217;s<br />all good. . No, and I, I think that&#8217;s another thing I&#8217;ve learned from y&#8217;all too, is like, hey, we can be,<br />this can be a subject that we get kinda tense about because we don&#8217;t know all the answers.<br />What I got from you, Sarah, was uh, you took, I think you took a big, big load of perfectionism,<br />expectation, worry, fear of people and release them to say, care about it. Get your team. Yes.<br />Like that&#8217;s the two I got when you&#8217;re looking at design. And that doesn&#8217;t mean just the design<br />team. That means the people who are out there publishing content on the website too.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Absolutely. You know, lean on your team and don&#8217;t exclude anybody. Include everybody in this<br />conversation and it matters. Anything else, Sarah, on design and creativity you wanted to<br />share? .<br />Sarah Gless: Yeah, I mean, I, I&#8217;ll echo I think a lot of what we&#8217;ve already talked about, but if you<br />could just, [00:47:00] at the end of the day, it&#8217;s, it&#8217;s about putting yourself in those folks&#8217; shoes.<br />And if, I think a great place to do that is by talking to those people, testing those people. Um, I, I<br />think that&#8217;s something that we, we don&#8217;t, you know, as a, um, a, a world , uh, probably do<br />enough of, um, and so empathy, empathy, empathy, just, you know, do the right thing, um, and,<br />and make it a value that you actually follow through with.<br />Cory Miller: Um, yep. Okay. I know you&#8217;re gonna have more to this chair. Thank you for sharing<br />the creativity. I think those are powerful messages that can release and really free people up to<br />use that creativity, use that, those innovative skills in such a really cool way. Yeah. Okay. So we<br />talked about leadership, talked about creativity and design.<br />Now let&#8217;s talk about the nuts and bolts, how this stuff works. Like [00:48:00] Chris. Uh, so you&#8217;re<br />back in, I know you work a lot with your team, uh, Sarah&#8217;s team, Mike&#8217;s team, um, in delivering<br />to the client. Um, when we talk about development, and you, you&#8217;ve, you&#8217;ve surprised me a<br />couple times on this Bec and, but it&#8217;s, it&#8217;s something that we just see.<br />It&#8217;s cuz you care about the subject, you know, you care about this work, but you&#8217;ve been able to<br />give some really good perspective too. But when we kind of venture into this third phase for<br />subject about accessibility, it&#8217;s the technical side. What sticks out to you? Uh, I always start with<br />you.<br />Chris Kindred: You&#8217;ve gotta make it part of your culture.<br />And in order to do that, that means that when you are hiring, you&#8217;ve gotta actually be looking to<br />make sure that you&#8217;re hiring people that believe the same. And, uh, it&#8217;s very difficult to always<br />create great accessible things if the, the people you&#8217;re looking at to bring on board don&#8217;t believe<br />the same thing.<br />[00:49:00] So it starts kind of there. It starts with making sure you get the right people in the right<br />seats and, and that, uh, piece of it. Um, after that there&#8217;s a little bit of understanding why, why<br />we&#8217;re doing this. And, um, one of the things that I like to kind of explain is that accessibility over<br />time has become the norm for, for so many places.<br />Um, think about it as, uh, curb cutouts right at crosswalks. Um, it&#8217;s so that it&#8217;s easier for<br />wheelchairs to get up onto the sidewalk. And, and it&#8217;s such a normal thing to see now. Um,<br />when you&#8217;re getting ready to cross the street and you hit the, the walk button, when it changes,<br />it makes a noise. Well, it&#8217;s because people found out, hey, we need to make this more<br />accessible for other people.<br />And, and they need to be able to get from one side of the street to the other. [00:50:00] And it, it,<br />it just, it, it becomes part of your everyday interaction and it becomes so normal that it, it, it just<br />becomes part of what you do. The same applies building a website. The same applies for the<br />technical side of these things.<br />When you&#8217;re building a form, you just, it, it, it is, it, it has to be ingrained in your culture that<br />that&#8217;s the normal way of doing that. You build it as an accessible form and you don&#8217;t cut corners.<br />Where, um, Somebody that&#8217;s not building it accessible or maybe somebody that doesn&#8217;t know or<br />is ignorant of how to build it accessible.<br />Um, would, would be doing that. You know, um, braille is another great example of having like a<br />braille inside a building trying to find where a, um, a, a hotel room is or an office is, that kind of<br />thing. You, it becomes normal and therefore you start [00:51:00] implementing it. You come to<br />expect it. And that&#8217;s, that&#8217;s a big<br />piece.<br />Mike Klanac: I, I just wanna jump in there, Chris, cause I think. The part that ties this all<br />together is the fact that those items you mentioned, which were initially built for accessible<br />purposes, how, how many other benefits have they shown to perhaps people with different<br />forms of acce, uh, disability or just really anyone like a curb cutout has, su has become a<br />convenience.<br />Um, the noise. I often just can hear that and it becomes a benefit to my experience not being a<br />disabled person. Um, and, and so those, those changes have, have become innovations for all<br />of us.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Chris Kindred: You, you mentioned a really good point there. Um, there&#8217;s different levels of, uh,<br />disability, let&#8217;s say. Yes. Um, you, you&#8217;ve got permanent disabilities, which are, are people that,<br />that aren&#8217;t going to get over whatever disability they have.<br />Mm-hmm. . And, and you also have, [00:52:00] uh, you know, that&#8217;s, uh, Loss of limb kind of<br />thing. Maybe not being able to type, not being able to hear, not being able to see those kinds of<br />things. Uh, you also have a concept of a temporary disability.<br />Uh, we, we&#8217;ve<br />all experience things like getting your eyes dilated and not being able to look at a website, uh,<br />that, that can really mess with your mind a little bit.<br />If, if a website has all the text way too close together, say you need to call your, uh, eye doctor<br />right after you left and you pull up their website on your phone and you can&#8217;t find the phone<br />number because you, your eyes are dilated. Um, yeah. Now, and there there&#8217;s also this concept<br />of situational disability.<br />Um, very similar. But, uh, say you&#8217;re sitting next to your four-year-old and on the couch and<br />you&#8217;re flipping through videos on your phone and you have the volume off cuz you don&#8217;t know<br />what somebody&#8217;s gonna say and you don&#8217;t want your four year old to hear it. Um, You know that<br />that&#8217;s another [00:53:00] case of an opportunity, that if they have transcripts on that video, all of<br />a sudden, you know what they&#8217;re talking about without having to maybe have your four year old<br />say a word they shouldn&#8217;t.<br />Um, you know, it, the, there&#8217;s, there&#8217;s this other concept a, around situational disabilities, um,<br />that I, it kind of hits home with me in particular because, um, there&#8217;s this level of like your<br />emotional state when you&#8217;re looking at a website, um, maybe your, your ability to actually have<br />like all the right, be in the right state of mind when you&#8217;re going to a, a website.<br />And it, uh, it, my, my daughter was born with a congenital heart defect. She was life flighted from<br />the hospital three days after she was born to a hospital five hours away.<br />Um,<br />My wife went with [00:54:00] her on, on the life flight, and we were extremely thankful she was<br />able to, but uh, here we are. I&#8217;m, I&#8217;m five hours away.<br />I&#8217;m getting ready to get in the car. There was a blizzard that night. There, there was just all kinds<br />of things going on, and I&#8217;ve gotta try to figure out how to get to this hospital and how to, um, find<br />my family, my newborn baby, all of this stuff. Uh, yeah. Eric Meyer does a very good talk on this.<br />Um, I, I think it was a, a list of part talk some, something like that.<br />Um, but it, it is a, a, a, it, it specifically talks about, uh, I think designing in a crisis or designing<br />for crisis. And, you know, if, if your mind&#8217;s not where it needs to be to read the information on a<br />website and you&#8217;re looking for how to get to an emergency room from the airport, And [00:55:00]<br />you are scrolling through a website.<br />I, I know websites pretty well. I&#8217;ve been reading websites my whole life, and I know that normally<br />there&#8217;s an address in the bottom left or right side of most websites. But if you&#8217;re trying to do that<br />looking through tiers, it&#8217;s much more difficult. And so there&#8217;s this level of, um, just because the,<br />there&#8217;s this level of morality that we talked about before, it&#8217;s the right thing to do.<br />But also it, it&#8217;s, it, it doesn&#8217;t, it, it can apply to anybody at any point in time. And you want to<br />make sure you&#8217;re being inclusive of all of those potential situations, especially when it&#8217;s, um, you<br />know, good or, or bad or, you know, education has alerts and all kinds of, there&#8217;s just, it, it<br />permeates through the entire industry.<br />Cory Miller: So before I come back to, to you, Chris, because I want you to put, uh, what the<br />question I&#8217;ll ask when I digress for a second with Sarah [00:56:00] is, uh, think about the<br />technical person on the other side in that seat and the challenges they have. But, you know,<br />Sarah, you, you do design. You know, you think about from the purpose of a website.<br />If I&#8217;m an er, I mean, Chris, you just said a hundred percent of people on that website, what do<br />they want to know? I wanna get to that building as fast as humanly possible. So Sarah, from a<br />pure design ux ui, that&#8217;s the purpose of a website. Is it not? Like, give people to the thing you<br />and your situational, uh, uh, experience.<br />Chris made me think. That&#8217;s, let&#8217;s, let&#8217;s take aside for a second. Accessibility. That&#8217;s just what<br />you wanna do with the website. Like absolutely. How do I, they are hunting, how do I put it right<br />in front of them? You know what I&#8217;m saying? Like from the design side .<br />Sarah Gless: Yes. Like know your audiences, [00:57:00] all of them prioritize, you know, and,<br />and ensure that you&#8217;re talking to them, you&#8217;re listening to them, you&#8217;re testing that work, and you</p>\n\n\n\n<p>know that it&#8217;s going to be there in, in a variety of situations.<br />It&#8217;s not just about slapping your brand on a website. It&#8217;s about ensuring that that experience is<br />meeting users where they&#8217;re at and serving their needs and, and, um, understanding the tests<br />they need to complete and, and designing to that. Um,<br />Cory Miller: like I go back to what you said, and this is reverberating now, and how deep, well,<br />what you said earlier is good accessibility is good design, and you go.<br />I mean, we can take it aside, all of this and just go, that&#8217;s the purpose. You wanna get people to<br />the thing they need to do. You want to empathize, use the word you used earlier, Sarah too, is<br />like, empathize. What are they trying to get done? Okay. I&#8217;m a, whatever the organization, Chris,<br />you just laid it out.<br />It&#8217;s blindingly obvious, the location. Think about that for restaurants. [00:58:00] Think about that<br />for any, any business, any organization, nonprofits, like, they come to you by the way, and<br />they&#8217;re looking for something and as fast and efficiently as you can get that to &#8217;em. So I go back<br />to your comment now, it&#8217;s even more deeper.<br />It&#8217;s like good accessibility is a good design because it&#8217;s about the action you&#8217;re trying to help that<br />person get to, right?<br />Sarah Gless: Absolutely. Yeah.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Chris Kindred: I, I would even take it a step further and say, good acceptability is usability. Mm-<br />hmm. Uh, it,</p>\n\n\n\n<p>it&#8217;s, it&#8217;s not just the design, but. It, it&#8217;s, it&#8217;s the total package of it.<br />It&#8217;s, it&#8217;s making sure that that button, when it&#8217;s clicked, you know, it was clicked and that it&#8217;s not<br />going to do something unexpected. You know, taking, taking it back to a technical point of view,<br />you know, making sure to know how to make sure a screen reader is announcing that button<br />that it was clicked um, making sure that, uh, the, the person knew what that button button<br />[00:59:00] was going to do and not just say, click here. You know, that making it clear<br />that<br />that&#8217;s what was going to happen when that button was clicked is a key aspect to it.<br />Cory Miller: So, Mike, I just go back down. Sorry. Go ahead, Sarah.<br />Sarah Gless: Yeah, I was just gonna go back to like what Mike said earlier about like, there&#8217;s<br />also like kind of these like side effects that are good side effects when you, when you design,<br />um, um, whatever the experience is, whether it&#8217;s a curb or a website, um, to be accessible, you<br />have all these.<br />Additional benefits for folks that may not have disabilities. So like in the case of the, um, the,<br />you know, the button to call the ER is not visible. Well, what if you designed it to be, well, I bet<br />you&#8217;re gonna pick up not just ensuring that like it&#8217;s accessible, but also a lot of users who may<br />not have disabilities, um, still struggle to find things on websites.<br />So like, you know, they&#8217;ll be able to get their tasks done. Um, professor too, I know it&#8217;s a very<br />hyper [01:00:00] specific example, but, but it does help provide like context, this bigger idea,<br />right?<br />Cory Miller: Hey Sarah, I think no, it&#8217;s a like proving you all&#8217;s point is the it. Let&#8217;s add another<br />one, Mike, to the first part you said, let&#8217;s add another one if, if you only use accessibility as to<br />make your site the best converting, most efficient tool for communicating to your customers.<br />We just like backed into, uh, because you, we&#8217;ve all gone back to these, like the usability thing.<br />If you&#8217;re forced to look at like, okay, let&#8217;s pull up JAWS or whatever tools you all use and<br />recommend for your clients, and let&#8217;s, let&#8217;s go at it from that perspective. You&#8217;ve empathized with<br />the customer and you think if we just put it under marketing or sales, I go, this is the exercise<br />most organizations should be doing.<br />Because you&#8217;re gonna go to the level and you&#8217;re gonna have to think about, I&#8217;m just talking the<br />business case. Okay? Every website [01:01:00] needs to spur an action, like we&#8217;re trying to lead<br />them to something. It could be a sale, it could be the address of the emergency room, it could<br />be whatever it is. I just go from the business case, Mike, like, this is an exercise that all of us<br />should be doing.<br />Because if you&#8217;re in Chris&#8217;s situation, you&#8217;re like, isn&#8217;t it clear? Everybody, everybody in the room<br />know what the key thing here is we&#8217;re trying to get people to the emergency room physically.<br />That informs design, it informs technical, but. Here&#8217;s another business case we should add.<br />Mike Klanac: Absolutely. Yeah, and it&#8217;s really inspiring to like see the conversation.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I think. As an entire, in the, across the world, evolve from being one where like the, the, the talk<br />that, that Chris just provided it, it probably used to have just been about like how to use like alt<br />tags. Like 10 years ago it would&#8217;ve been like, how do we tag content? And now it&#8217;s, it&#8217;s crossed<br />into like more of a phil philosophical understanding that, hey, this is, this is, um, this is [01:02:00]<br />good business.<br />This is a usability opportunity, this is a chance to empathize with our users. This is a chance to,<br />um, improve customer and user journeys and, and, uh, make it easier for you to check out or to<br />get the information that you need. Um, so it&#8217;s, I just am it, it, I, I&#8217;m, I like that the dots are starting<br />to be connected and that this conversation has changed from just like a very sort of niche<br />technical, how do I.<br />Do these things that I have to do, because otherwise I&#8217;m gonna get in trouble to look at all of this<br />opportunity that we have to incorporate this thinking to better serve our audience that affects,<br />that, improves our business and makes everybody happier. I mean, uh, it connects a lot of dots.<br />Cory Miller: It&#8217;s cool. I, I&#8217;m not exaggerating, but maybe we should rename this panel to how to<br />build a successful website.<br />Yeah. , I mean, I know I&#8217;m exaggerating a little bit, but I go, like, when you were talking through<br />that, Sarah, I thought [01:03:00] that is a focusing feature. It makes us ask the question, what&#8217;s<br />this all about? What are we trying to do? Well, if we can hit it in all these scenarios, we&#8217;ve<br />crystal, we&#8217;ve used it as an exercise honestly, to crystallize what we&#8217;re trying to get from it and<br />pave the way, like that&#8217;s the purpose of website, right?<br />Mm-hmm. , so Absolutely. Okay. I&#8217;m preaching the choir, but I&#8217;m just hearing what you&#8217;re saying<br />and going, yeah. We should. Totally. I think the other title is it&#8217;s not a problem, it&#8217;s an opportunity,<br />you know? Yeah. Okay. Chris, I have veered all the way, but I think it&#8217;s been good. We need this<br />out in the world. We need people to hear these things and appreciate you all sharing so<br />authentically with this.<br />So, back to the question, Chris, I&#8217;m gonna get back to you. So from a technical standpoint,<br />there&#8217;s, on your clients, you&#8217;ve, you&#8217;ve talked to a number, I mean number of teams in the<br />technical side. And you know, part of my question here is trying to help the leaders listening to<br />other people, the other parts of this team understand [01:04:00] there are issues like Sarah did<br />for design that designers have, there&#8217;s somewhere technical.<br />What are the things that stick out to you, you know, those challenges people the technical side<br />has when they&#8217;re working on this particular subject of accessibility?<br />Chris Kindred: Uh, I, I would say it&#8217;s, it&#8217;s keeping up with the changes as they come. Um,<br />that&#8217;s, that&#8217;s one of the big ones. Uh, you know, there, there are different requirements.<br />Uh, those, there&#8217;s more stringent requirements when it comes to WIC ag, which is if, if you&#8217;re a<br />front-end developer and, and backend developers to, uh, knowing what the requirements are to<br />hit certain levels, depending on kind of going back into the legal side of it, you&#8217;re, you&#8217;re certain<br />you&#8217;re gonna be required to hit a certain level of accessibility.<br />And knowing what those are and how they change over time is a big piece of it. And, uh,<br />[01:05:00] at, at Modern Tribe, we really lean a lot on our front end developers for keeping up<br />with that. But also we communicate as a whole and, and we make sure that everybody&#8217;s, you<br />know, doing code reviews for each other and, and that kind of thing to make sure that, uh, if, if<br />there is an accessibility, um, Item that we address it before it goes out, uh, and that, uh, those<br />kinds of things.<br />So it, it, I would say the, the biggest issue is trying to just stay relevant with those, um,<br />accessibility changes. Every time a browser comes out with something new, you&#8217;ve gotta kind of<br />go back and look at it and see if it changed the way you need to implement something based<br />upon those accessibility requirements.<br />So, yeah.<br />Cory Miller: So from, so from the technical side, there&#8217;s how, how any general guidance you&#8217;d<br />give for how to kind of stay touched. It seemed to [01:06:00] me, you know, from a team<br />standpoint is we just regularly have the discuss. Like the topic comes up regularly enough,<br />however that is, but those developers that want to contribute, technical people that want to<br />contribute to it.<br />Any, any thoughts there about how they could try to keep up and places to go?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Chris Kindred: Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. Uh, so there&#8217;s, we, we use a lot of different tools and,<br />and that kind of thing, but you can always go to the WAC website and, and that&#8217;s going to tell<br />you exactly what you need to hit and, and how to perform certain actions in an accessible way.<br />Uh, but, but there&#8217;s also some other things out there. Um, uh, I A A P certifications, uh, the, this<br />is a, um, it, it&#8217;s a, uh, they offer a web accessibility certification that you can get and, uh, it, it<br />teaches you a, about web accessibility, and you [01:07:00] can go through the whole, whole<br />process there and, uh, you know, There&#8217;s no better way to prove that accessibility&#8217;s serious to<br />you than getting some kind of certification For sure.<br />Um, it&#8217;s, it&#8217;s not, uh, an easy thing to do. There. There are other certifications out there too. Um,<br />that&#8217;s just the first one that came to my mind. But, uh, th those types of certifications are, are<br />nice to be able to go out and do and, and learn. Um, and if you&#8217;re making it part of your culture,<br />then you&#8217;re always talking about it.<br />It&#8217;s, it&#8217;s like, like I said, it&#8217;s part of those code reviews. Um, if, if, if I&#8217;m reviewing somebody&#8217;s<br />code and I&#8217;m, I&#8217;m seeing it, I&#8217;m learning too. If they implemented something that I may not have<br />been aware of yet, uh, that, that&#8217;s a big piece as well. So mm-hmm. that, that being able to<br />communicate back and forth about &#8217;em, uh, is, is also super beneficial.<br />Cory Miller: Mike, did you have something to add? probably jumped the gun<br />Mike Klanac: a little bit. I, I [01:08:00] think I was going to start to mention tooling a little and its<br />role in this and, and Chris hit it a, a touch there. But, um, yeah, I mean this is a, this is a, a open<br />conversation. So, you know, it&#8217;s, it&#8217;s something that it, you have to kind of revisit periodically.<br />And the, the tooling, one of the things that it does besides kind of educate you and their, their<br />job is to stay current on creating a system of scans that, um, enforces certain standards. Um, it,<br />it, it allows you to kind of revisit it on a regular basis, uh, and that there is some. There&#8217;s a huge<br />role for that, right?<br />Like it no, no human can actually stay on top of all of the changes at all times. The, that<br />provides some nice rails. And yeah, as we get into this, perhaps this last section in a moment<br />where we talk about the, the, the content publishing or the sort of the, the end user role in<br />[01:09:00] accessibility, um, I think that tooling is a, a key<br />Cory Miller: part of that as well.<br />Okay. So I want to ask Chris one more thing. So this whole banner is accessibility for sure, but<br />WordPress accessibility, I think that&#8217;s the two parts of this why I asked you all to do this<br />particular topic because, you know, accessibility, but you also know the nuances with<br />WordPress like you&#8217;re experts.<br />Travis has been around for a very long time doing some really cool stuff with WordPress forever.<br />So, uh, Chris, my question is now accessibility with WordPress. Things that come out, stand out<br />with you with this amazing open source software that we love that&#8217;s used around the globe and<br />it&#8217;s great solutions for clients.<br />Um, what things stick out there with WordPress accessibility particularly?<br />Chris Kindred: Uh, well, well first open source software. It, it is always, um, it, people are<br />always talking about accessibility. If you go into the, the WordPress Slack, you can see people<br />trying [01:10:00] to focus on accessibility and try to get accessibility into, uh, everything.<br />Uh, you know, I guess it was two or three years, Gutenberg did a big accessibility audit on all<br />the blocks, and that was really important for WordPress to be doing to help move the editor itself<br />forward and make it more accessible for content editors. Um, but as Gutenberg&#8217;s matured and,<br />and become the block editor, it&#8217;s, it&#8217;s become everybody&#8217;s focus.<br />There&#8217;s this new opportunity and, and I think that, uh, As we continue to implement these<br />accessible designs that our, our amazing designers have put together and, and our developers<br />have gone in and, and put a lot of work behind the templates and building out the header and<br />the footer and, and everything, there&#8217;s this, uh, there&#8217;s this content piece that is going to have to<br />be implemented and most of the time that&#8217;s by the client.<br />And [01:11:00] the, the best way to help them would be by creating plugins that test the<br />accessibility before it&#8217;s ever even published. And being able to interface with a service that<br />allows you to check that and give feedback in a meaningful way to a publisher and being able to<br />tell them, this is inaccessible and here is why.<br />Because that&#8217;s a key point too, making sure they know why, so they don&#8217;t always have to fix it<br />every time they do it. Um, and, and being able to flag that the way that editor works now</p>\n\n\n\n<p>compared to way it worked with the classic editor. It, it gives you so many more opportunities for<br />that kind of, um, benefit.<br />So, so creating a, a plugin, you know, it, it&#8217;s something that I, I know a few places have tried to<br />create these, and, and there&#8217;s, there&#8217;s an opportunity to be able to, to do that. And I, I really, I&#8217;m<br />looking forward to, [01:12:00] uh, potentially participating and creating a plugin that can handle<br />that kind of thing. Um, you know, flagging it, uh, checking it from the front, inside, all of those<br />kinds of things for a user, um, that, that would be a, a huge benefit to the community as a whole<br />and, and to content creators.<br />Cory Miller: I, I think you pointed at something that I often don&#8217;t, I, I kind of gloss over, but the<br />fact that there&#8217;s so many people, the power of WordPress is so many people collaborating and<br />caring about this. Yes. This isn&#8217;t a new thing to WordPress. It&#8217;s what I. It&#8217;s, we&#8217;re, we&#8217;re<br />imperfect, but as a community. And the core software has a very passion for diversity, equity,<br />inclusion in that conversation has been championed by people like you and others in the<br />community to make sure WordPress is always accessible.<br />But having said that, there&#8217;s still things, there&#8217;s still things that we need to account for. And you<br />brought those up as like, well, we did in the discussions. It&#8217;s like you can do all the [01:13:00]<br />front end work and then you&#8217;re down to the person that just hasn&#8217;t had the opportunity to be<br />trained a little bit.<br />And the block editor, there are things that need, that are being discussed actively and worked<br />on in the community to need to be done to ensure the other part of this. We got the great first<br />site, but now, okay, we&#8217;re turning over and I, I think it was, Sarah mentioned one of the previous<br />conversations is one, you know, a blog post.<br />Could break the accessibility. You know, one thing that would just because you have so much<br />power, I mean, it&#8217;s the beauty of Good Berg and the block editor, you have so much opportunity<br />there, . You also have an opportunity to kind of go into and break your, all your good work<br />you&#8217;ve done to try to be accessible.<br />Okay. Anything else on technical? And then I wanna divide, dive in with the remain time and<br />thank you all for your time and sharing your expertise so openly. Um, the next section, just about<br />that side of this whole thing is like the other part of the team that might not be in some of the<br />core conversations but are executing, doing the work.<br />[01:14:00] Anything else? Chris, though, before we shift gears into that?<br />Chris Kindred: Uh, technical is such a code dependent thing that it could get. I, I could drown<br />you in what Aria labels mean and why and why not. But you know, the fact is if you&#8217;ve put a<br />culture in place around accessibility, then. It&#8217;s, it&#8217;s something that your devs are going to be able<br />to help you with.<br />And, uh, it, it&#8217;s, it&#8217;s just part of, part of the process.<br />Cory Miller: I&#8217;ve heard. I&#8217;ve, I think another theme in all this is like, if you&#8217;re a designer,<br />developer on the team in some way, uh, this is your webinar to go back if you need help in<br />reinforcements, saying, Hey, we need to embrace this. Um, because I know so many talented<br />designer developers, good hearts, wanna do the right thing, need the resources, you know?<br />Yeah. Need that collaboration.<br />Sarah Gless: Be champions of, yeah. [01:15:00] Making sure this, this is a conversation. Um,<br />and, and feel empowered to like, Take that upwards towards, towards leadership.<br />Cory Miller: Yeah. And share this link afterwards so they Yeah. Can come in here us talk about<br />the amazing opportunity they have here. Yeah. Okay.<br />Thanks Chris. All right. So final section is just this part. You&#8217;ve done all the fronting work, you do<br />care, you&#8217;re doing all the efforts, but then there&#8217;s this situation you already mentioned that they<br />could break it on that particular page because of the power of some of the word and and the<br />lack of the resources and training and guidance.<br />So when we get to this side, the client publishing of all this, who wants to share, what do you got<br />locked and loaded? I wanna just kind of put it here. Cause I think this is another team<br />collaboration of like probably people that are oftentimes overlooked, blamed sometimes, and<br />just don&#8217;t have this side of it that we need to be thinking about from leadership all the way down<br />through the organiz.<br />Mike Klanac: [01:16:00] Yeah, this is a, a really important part of it that oftentimes gets<br />overlooked. Um, and that is just to be really clear, it&#8217;s that after these tools have been created, a</p>\n\n\n\n<p>lot of accessibility thinking has gone into them, and then they are delivered to, um, you know, a,<br />a content publisher to, to maintain and to use for, for possibly up to five years.<br />Um, you&#8217;re at this key point where as a, maybe an agency partner supporting someone, like<br />you&#8217;re putting a lot of that power into their hands now to pick up that, that, that torch and<br />continue to run with it. Um, and there&#8217;s a really unfortunate metaphor here, which is, you know,<br />MySpace, you know, we can all recall MySpace.<br />It was really great. No longer exists today. They were very well intended. And at some point it<br />went from being this nice. Tidy page with a profile to music blaring and the thousands of like<br />scrolling pages and things [01:17:00] jumping out all over. And that&#8217;s because there was not<br />enough rails put into place for content publishers to be success successful for the long haul<br />there.<br />So we&#8217;ve, we&#8217;ve sort of come to the realization, and this is kind of part of like ergonomic thinking<br />and you know, you have to set these content publishers up for success. And the way that you<br />do that is not only in how you&#8217;re architecting the system, the publishing environment, um, to give<br />instruction, to make it just like intuitive and easy to use and sort of like heuristic and you can<br />kind of just, you can figure it out.<br />It&#8217;s simple. Um, but like training them on the idea of publishing accessible content because we,<br />no matter how many guardrails we put into place, if you&#8217;re not thinking about it, you will<br />eventually break the system by putting in. You know, content that is not accessible. Uh, so we<br />try to incorporate that into our training [01:18:00] process.<br />Um, and, and let, let be pretty candid upfront to say, you&#8217;ve got a, a wonderfully accessible site<br />right now. It won&#8217;t be this way if you put in concerning content with, you know, strange things<br />that, that perhaps like in the moment feel really exciting, but you know, they&#8217;re, they&#8217;re not<br />gonna, they&#8217;re not gonna work from an accessibility standpoint.<br />It&#8217;s something you need to continue to think about. Um,<br />Cory Miller: I mean, this goes back, that&#8217;s first part of it. Yeah. This goes back to your, your part<br />and two is the leader and the people making the decisions need to think about all of this that,<br />okay. Part one is just getting the infrastructure, the, the base. Part two is people have to operate<br />within that base and we need to be considerate and give ample resource.<br />To to hear because all of our good intentions could go away. . Yeah. When, when inadvertently<br />someone who does care, [01:19:00] makes a, makes a decision that affects it. So putting that<br />into the process is, is huge. And I think I&#8217;ve heard variously E three talk about the training and<br />the ongoing maintenance and upkeep of your knowledge about how these things operate, um,<br />isn&#8217;t a very important part of all of this.<br />Um, yes sir. Chris, you mentioned tooling or I think Mike got into tooling too earlier. So that<br />seems to be one part, as I&#8217;ve talked to you all, part of this is like just proper tooling to do some<br />as much as we can, as this continues to evolve and change with browsers and different<br />technology and stuff.<br />But, so can you talk to me a little bit about the tooling side?<br />Chris Kindred: Yeah. Uh, so. Tools we use, um, we use Site Improve Dubbo. Um, some of<br />those that what they&#8217;ll do is they&#8217;ll actually go out and put your, put the URL in there and it will<br />scrape your site and tell you what kind of, um, accessibility issues come up.[01:20:00]<br />Uh, they&#8217;re, they&#8217;re great tools that, that kind of thing helps a lot. And, and you can automate<br />that process to run weekly, daily, monthly, however often you want it to. Uh, and, and that&#8217;s a<br />really great check, but I, I really feel like you should be doing something before that. And, and<br />the easiest way to do that is by installing a browser extension on, you know, if you&#8217;re using<br />Chrome, Chrome has ax and you can install AX on your, on your browser, and then you can go<br />pull up your page and it&#8217;s gonna tell you the same stuff, but you&#8217;re just gonna catch it before<br />somebody else did.<br />You know, make it part of your publishing process that you publish a page. Go pull up X on, on<br />the front end and make sure that there&#8217;s not a glaring problem. Um, when you&#8217;re dealing with<br />Go ahead.<br />Sarah Gless: Go ahead. I was just gonna say even, even before that, um, too, it&#8217;s, it&#8217;s the<br />training aspect that, that we mentioned earlier.<br />Um, you know, from [01:21:00] a kind of content side of things, established guidelines and, and<br />make sure that they&#8217;re accessible by everyone on your team that&#8217;s creating content and that</p>\n\n\n\n<p>they&#8217;re updated regularly, um, as things change and evolve with, uh, within the accessibility<br />world. Um, so people are, are making good content from the start.<br />So we, we looked at it a little bit backwards, but I I, I like that because it, yeah, it kinda leads<br />back to that, that person,<br />Cory Miller: the two sides are seems like tools and training the two sides of the airplane, you<br />know? Um, so the,<br />Chris Kindred: there&#8217;s, there&#8217;s one more piece that I wanna mention is that you can always fix<br />what&#8217;s in the editor.<br />It&#8217;s not, you didn&#8217;t just destroy your site forever because you posted one piece of content that<br />was, uh, that had an accessibility problem, evaluate it, go back in and fix it. It&#8217;s not the, the<br />whole point is being aware. Yeah. It&#8217;s when you didn&#8217;t go back and fix it. It&#8217;s [01:22:00] knowing<br />it was there and ignoring it.<br />Those kinds of things that will really get you going along a<br />bad path,<br />Mike Klanac: right. I mean, people are gonna make mistakes. In fact, I&#8217;m assuming at some<br />point someone will look back at this webinar and think they said something incorrect. Um, the<br />point is that we care and we&#8217;re we&#8217;re trying to do the right thing.<br />Um, and, and so I think you&#8217;re right, Chris, like going back, if someone identifies an issue, you<br />can fix it. I mean, that&#8217;s the best thing about this is nothing set in stone here forever.<br />Cory Miller: That is the beauty of the web. I used to be in new newspapers, and when you<br />printed a mistake, it went out . I can&#8217;t imagine we had this opportunity to make it, to fix it.<br />Go back and fix it. Um, well, I, I like that. Any other thoughts on the training and tooling side?<br />Um, making sure, you know, I, I assume all this when you&#8217;re, we&#8217;re talking about like checklists<br />and workflows, like making [01:23:00] sure this is things you do with clients. Like, Hey, there&#8217;s<br />somebody in, not in this meeting and hasn&#8217;t been privy to all this<br />Here you go. Here&#8217;s some basic stuff to look at. I don&#8217;t know if that&#8217;s style sheets. I don&#8217;t know if<br />that&#8217;s like, earlier you talk, you know, Sarah, about like the colors of your logo and then how<br />does that transit translate accessibly And, uh, Chris again, any, anything like that you think as<br />you&#8217;re, you&#8217;ve been working with clients for a long time with this particular thing.<br />What you do that kind of makes the difference for someone you know, is, are there style guides?<br />Are there. Typical things they do. How do you approach this from alus perspective on that<br />training? Like, do you build in like, you know, um, training with a team or I, you know, anything<br />on that regard?<br />Mike Klanac: I, I could probably add one more thing, which is that we, you know, there&#8217;s a lot of<br />intention in the, in the design and the construction of content, so I, if you do that right, [01:24:00]<br />the, the publishers experie.<br />Is pretty like straightforward. It&#8217;s about the quality of the content and the messaging and less the<br />construction of it, and therefore like there&#8217;s less opportunity to get creative at that point. You&#8217;re,<br />you&#8217;re sort of like focused on like what the message, the content&#8217;s trying to convey is, and not<br />so much how the looks and where it positions or if you do have some editorial power at that<br />point.<br />It&#8217;s from a predetermined set of, of configuration. So you&#8217;re like putting the content in and<br />flipping levers and hitting buttons from pre-approved standards that everyone was agreed, uh, in<br />agreement on and happened to be accessible. Um, so if that, that work upfront has been done<br />well, those are some of those guardrails and I, I think that that can, that can help continue<br />success into the future.<br />Chris Kindred: That&#8217;s where Gutenberg has made things so much easier [01:25:00] for, for us.<br />We can go in and create patterns and build out those patterns to be accessible and, and meet a<br />certain, um, layout that sales teams provided the front end to, to be able to do. And, and so<br />we&#8217;ve, we&#8217;ve said, okay, here&#8217;s, here&#8217;s a pattern you can use that we&#8217;ve already vetted as an<br />accessible pattern, and, and you don&#8217;t have to worry about it.<br />If you use this pattern, you&#8217;re good. And then you can use the next pattern. You&#8217;re good, and,<br />and you can kinda work your way down the page that way. And it, it makes things better for the<br />end user. And, you know, that&#8217;s, that&#8217;s everybody&#8217;s goal here. How can we do what&#8217;s best for the<br />end user using WordPress to publish and then in turn their users<br />coming to the website.<br />Cory Miller: All right. Anything else on that? And before we do some takeaways,</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Mike Klanac: I think that pretty much covers it.<br />Cory Miller: This has been like, I think it&#8217;s [01:26:00] beyond primer. What this is is helping one,<br />somebody that does want to care, that cares, takes some meaningful steps about holistically<br />embracing this. Um, and with really solid business and human reasons attached. And I think<br />part of this that I was surprised a little bit is just the thinking when we got into accessibility.<br />It&#8217;s like actually you can, you can make money doing the good thing, doing the right thing. Um,<br />Maybe more money because we&#8217;ve talked about the one in 6, 1, 1 in four in America in<br />particular. But, and, and then the situational that you did, Chris, permanent, situational,<br />temporary Mike, really sharing, um, the, that, that whole case to help us think about that.<br />Um, so I, I love it. And I think the big headline is don&#8217;t look at this as a problem. Look at this as<br />an opportunity. And I think you all have masterfully shared some really compelling, [01:27:00]<br />you can&#8217;t look away from reasons why this should be like the center of, not just the project, not<br />just the website Pro, but culturally as a, as an organization, how we&#8217;re gonna be in the world.<br />And I think it&#8217;s pretty, pretty awesome. Anything we missed? Anything you wanna share? Um,<br />that we didn&#8217;t touch?<br />Mike Klanac: I&#8217;ll just like, my final thought on this was, first of all, again, thank you Corey, for, for<br />recording this. I, I like the opportunity to sometimes approach these topics from a new angle<br />and, and specifically as it relates to accessibility.<br />There&#8217;s been a lot of talks and accessibility and a lot of times they do get pretty in the weeds.<br />Um, because that&#8217;s an important part of this is understanding the weeds and the, the specifics.<br />Um, but what I was, what really drew me to this conversation was the ability to take a step back<br />and, and think about, uh, this topic more holistically as it relates across all the layers of culture<br />and business.<br />Um, both like at a, working with an agency partner, but in your own organization and how doing<br />that, [01:28:00] um, can ultimately bring you a lot of success. So I appreciated the new angle on<br />it.<br />Cory Miller: Sarah, Chris, any any save takeaways or thought.<br />Sarah Gless: Yeah, I think like my, my biggest kind of takeaways are how critical it is for, um,<br />you know, organizations to truly like, resource for this.<br />Don&#8217;t, you know, it&#8217;s, it&#8217;s kind of that idea of like, show don&#8217;t tell, like make it part of your values.<br />Sure. But then show it, right? And, and, and put resources towards it. I think that, um, is a<br />critical step in making sure this is truly valued, um, at your organization and that you&#8217;re<br />connecting with your, your audiences.<br />Chris Kindred: Uh, I, I really agree. Uh, I, I agree with everything that&#8217;s been said, but you<br />know, I, I think Mike talking along the points of, there&#8217;s a bunch of talks out there about<br />accessibility from a technical point of view, [01:29:00] from, uh, how to implement and, and<br />those kinds of things. But I, I think one of the places that struggles the most is, um,<br />Organizations understanding that it costs a lot of money to do that, and it, it costs a lot of money<br />because they&#8217;ve been going at it the wrong way, and they&#8217;ve been coming at it from kind of an<br />inside out, not an outside in, and not making it like sarason not making it part of your culture.<br />And if you can make it part of every piece, it&#8217;s not, it&#8217;s not going to be as expensive as it is if you</p>\n\n\n\n<p>have to remediate something once it&#8217;s all done. Uh, so it, it&#8217;s, um, this has been very eye-<br />opening to me to, I don&#8217;t think many people are looking at it from this direction. And I, I, uh, am</p>\n\n\n\n<p>am excited to be a part of that.<br />Cory Miller: Well, thank you three for sharing. Uh, so openly, uh, your expertise and experience<br />about [01:30:00] this pretty vital, you know, topic that if we&#8217;re working on the web, it&#8217;s just, In<br />fact, it&#8217;s, we&#8217;ve illustrated some good points, but appreciate you all for being and sharing so<br />openly and taking your time. I know it&#8217;s, it&#8217;s a Friday now as we&#8217;re recording, but, um, you have,<br />you have those clients waiting on you.<br />Mike, would you share a little bit how can someone heard what you all have shared and talk,<br />start the conversation with Modern Tribe.<br />Mike Klanac: Yeah, for sure. If anybody has a, a follow on question or wants to talk to Modern<br />Tribe about the work that we do, um, our website is, uh, t r i.be. Um, so you can Google Search<br />Modern Tribe, we pop up around there, uh, the first couple responses.<br />Um, you can also reach me@helloattri.be and um, You know, our goal is to be helpful. So I I<br />really, we do this quite often. If you just have a question, we&#8217;re happy to, to just just talk about</p>\n\n\n\n<p>stuff. So it doesn&#8217;t always [01:31:00] have to be reaching out if you have a, a new project<br />opportunity. This is important to us.<br />We like to hear from people and, uh, yeah, build relationships with everyone in the space. So<br />that&#8217;s how you can reach us. And, and thanks again. And Corey, and then, and the work that<br />post status is doing, carrying these topics through, uh, to the audience. It, it&#8217;s really, really<br />important.<br />Cory Miller: Yeah. I, I think we&#8217;ve got a couple more to topics to pull back because I&#8217;ve, I&#8217;ve<br />already identified some ones that I want to go.<br />I go, I think there&#8217;s more here that I kind of hear, heard that like it may be more, more a specific<br />treatment. So, but Sarah, Chris, Mike, thank you for today. Appreciate your time, what you do<br />and WordPress and the larger world, uh, out there. So have a great, uh, rest of your day. Thank<br />you for being here.<br />Cheers.<br />Mike Klanac: Good talk.<br />Cory Miller: Bye.</p>\n<p>This article was published at Post Status — the community for WordPress professionals.</p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Wed, 15 Mar 2023 22:35:37 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:11:\"Cory Miller\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:24;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:63:\"Post Status: Launching a WordPress Product in Public: Session 5\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:32:\"https://poststatus.com/?p=148247\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:73:\"https://poststatus.com/launching-a-wordpress-product-in-public-session-5/\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:86910:\"<div class=\"is-layout-flow wp-block-group eplus-wrapper has-theme-palette-2-color has-theme-palette-8-background-color has-text-color has-background\"><div class=\"wp-block-group__inner-container\"><div class=\"wp-block-post-excerpt\"><p class=\"wp-block-post-excerpt__excerpt\">In this episode, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/coreymaass\">Corey Maass</a> and <a href=\"https://twitter.com/corymiller303\">Cory Miller</a> discuss a range of topics related to the development of their new product <a href=\"https://crop.express/\">Crop.Express</a>,  including the importance of empathy in designing user interfaces, the challenges of marketing and selling products, and the need for developers to collaborate with others and develop non-technical skills. They each share their experiences from working on various projects over the years and offer insights and advice based on these experiences. </p></div>\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-spacer eplus-wrapper\"></div>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"yoast-reading-time__wrapper\"><span class=\"yoast-reading-time__icon\"></span><span class=\"yoast-reading-time__spacer\"></span><span class=\"yoast-reading-time__descriptive-text\">Estimated reading time:  </span><span class=\"yoast-reading-time__reading-time\">60</span><span class=\"yoast-reading-time__time-unit\"> minutes</span></p>\n</div></div>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://poststatus.com/planet/feed/#h-transcript\">Transcript</a> ↓</p>\n\n\n\n<p>As the development of <a href=\"https://crop.express/\">Crop.Express</a> continues, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/corymiller303\">Cory Miller</a> and <a href=\"https://twitter.com/coreymaass\">Corey Maass</a> continue to gain clarity on what is needed for their product to succeed. They discuss features and integration, free vs. paid versions, ensuring compatibility, and more, as they fold in their experience, expertise, and gathered feedback into the future strategy of their product business.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Top Takeaways:</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Cultivating empathy is important for developers.</strong> It&#8217;s essential to understand the needs of different users, particularly those who are not very tech-savvy or who come from different cultural backgrounds. Empathy helps create products that are more user-friendly and accessible to a broader audience.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Collaboration is crucial for success.</strong> No matter how brilliant a product developer is, they can&#8217;t do everything on their own. They need a team of people with different skills and backgrounds to support them, whether it&#8217;s in terms of design, marketing, or other areas. Building a supportive team requires humility and a willingness to accept feedback and help from others.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Failure is a necessary part of growth.</strong> Many product developers go through a difficult experience where they realize that their work isn&#8217;t as good as they thought it was. This experience can be humbling, but it&#8217;s also an opportunity to learn and grow. It&#8217;s important for developers to be open to feedback, to take risks, and to be willing to try new things, even if it means making mistakes along the way.</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\">\n\n</div>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"eplus-wrapper\" id=\"h-mentioned-in-the-show\"><img src=\"https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/14.0.0/72x72/1f517.png\" alt=\"🔗\" class=\"wp-smiley\" /> Mentioned in the show:</h3>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.stickermule.com/\">Sticker Mule</a></li>\n\n\n\n<li><a href=\"https://www.canva.com/\">Canva</a></li>\n\n\n\n<li><a href=\"https://www.kickstarter.com/\">Kickstarter</a></li>\n\n\n\n<li><a href=\"https://unsplash.com/\">Unsplash</a></li>\n\n\n\n<li><a href=\"https://www.stockunlimited.com/\">Stock Unlimited</a></li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"eplus-wrapper\" id=\"h-you-can-follow-post-status-and-our-guests-on-twitter\"><img src=\"https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/14.0.0/72x72/1f426.png\" alt=\"🐦\" class=\"wp-smiley\" /> You can follow Post Status and our guests on Twitter:</h3>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"eplus-wrapper\">\n<li><a href=\"http://twitter.com/coreymaass\">Corey Maass</a></li>\n\n\n\n<li><a href=\"https://twitter.com/corymiller303\">Cory Miller</a> (CEO, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/post_status\">Post Status</a>)</li>\n\n\n\n<li><a href=\"https://twitter.com/lemonadecode\">Olivia Bisset</a> (Intern, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/post_status\">Post Status</a>)</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"eplus-wrapper has-background\">The <strong>Post Status Draft</strong> podcast is geared toward WordPress professionals, with interviews, news, and deep analysis. <img src=\"https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/14.0.0/72x72/1f4dd.png\" alt=\"📝\" class=\"wp-smiley\" /><br /><br /><a href=\"https://poststatus.com/category/post-status-podcasts/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Browse our archives</a>, and don’t forget to subscribe via <a href=\"https://itunes.apple.com/us/podcast/post-status-draft-wordpress/id976403008\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">iTunes</a>, <a href=\"https://podcasts.google.com/feed/aHR0cHM6Ly9mZWVkcy5zaW1wbGVjYXN0LmNvbS8ySkU5c2M4UA\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Google Podcasts</a>, <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/c/PostStatus\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">YouTube</a>, <a href=\"http://www.stitcher.com/podcast/krogsgard/post-status-draft-wordpress-podcast\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Stitcher</a>, <a href=\"https://wordpress-post-status-draft-podcast.simplecast.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Simplecast</a>, or <a href=\"https://feeds.simplecast.com/2JE9sc8P\">RSS</a>. <img src=\"https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/14.0.0/72x72/1f3a7.png\" alt=\"🎧\" class=\"wp-smiley\" /></p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"eplus-wrapper\" id=\"h-transcript\">Transcript</h2>\n\n\n\n<h2>Session 5 Corey &amp; Cory Launch a WordPress Product Live</h2>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Corey:</strong> [00:00:00] Session five, and I&#8217;m opening the comments on the YouTubes pop out. Hello? </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Yeah, I should do this too. Okay. Oh, shouldn&#8217;t&nbsp;  </p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>cory:</strong> the recorded bit, we&#8217;ll do it live.  </p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Corey:</strong> Is there any other way? I mean,  </p>\n\n\n\n<p>there&#8217;s no&nbsp;  </p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>cory:</strong> one, no other way, but to do it live, at least for Corey and Corey  </p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Corey:</strong> Otherwise, there&#8217;s too much to think about. Exactly.&nbsp;  </p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>cory:</strong> Who wants, who wants, uh, [00:01:00] Perfection. All right. So, hey everybody. This is, uh, Corey and Corey launching a WordPress product in public and session five. And, you know, life happens. And so I&#8217;m actually at a hospital. Uh, my brother, uh, got into the hospital earlier this week and just checking on him.  </p>\n\n\n\n<p>He&#8217;s all good, by the way. Um, anyway, so session five.&nbsp;  </p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Corey:</strong> Um, how was the jello? These are the things that matter. That&#8217;s true.&nbsp;  </p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>cory:</strong> I have not asked. He&#8217;s not been able to eat, but, um, people are pretty awesome. Yeah. Here taking care of them. Good. Glad to hear it. Um, so first things first, we get our first feedback.&nbsp;  </p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Corey:</strong> Yep, yep.  </p>\n\n\n\n<p>So after all of our discussion around, uh, The most important thing being feedback. How do we collect feedback? I built [00:02:00] into the plugin, um, with your guidance, you know, the most direct way, like I went, we could have just linked to a contact form, but I was like, we want this to be frictionless. So there&#8217;s a button right next to every.  </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Big call to action that says, um, you know, give us feedback or something. Um, and so, and it worked, a little, a little relieved because I, I wound up doing some crazy email routing to get it all, um, signed up because, you know, one of the things with a new product is you don&#8217;t want to just like, you don&#8217;t want to pr optimize prematurely.  </p>\n\n\n\n<p>You don&#8217;t want to pay, start paying for services. And so we are, um, using a number of email forwards from my registrar to a Gmail account to each of us using aliases and various Gmail accounts. So it&#8217;s a little more complicated. But that way [00:03:00] we&#8217;re not spending 16 bucks a month on Google Workspace, you know, before we&#8217;ve.  </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Received an email. So, um, but yeah, the, the first email was positive or encouraging, I should say. Um,&nbsp;  </p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>cory:</strong> yeah. And basically, do you, do you know him? Do you know&nbsp;  </p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Corey:</strong> who it is? I, I don&#8217;t think so.&nbsp;  </p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>cory:</strong> I don&#8217;t either. So that&#8217;s, that&#8217;s even better because it&#8217;s somebody that we, um, so I&#8217;ll, I&#8217;ll read it if you, if you want me to, Corey?  </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Yeah. Yeah. So I, I don&#8217;t know his name and it looks like his last name, but we&#8217;ll keep that anonymous. Uh, nice start. I would love it if you could work on more fe than featured images. Good affirmation. Wanna be able to do it with just an image on a page. And he gave us a link. Um, this kinda&nbsp;  </p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Corey:</strong> seems link, the link, just so you know, all of the emails will include, i, I auto appended the site, u r url.  </p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:04:00] Gotcha. So we have, um, you know, so we can go and do a little sneaky research.&nbsp;  </p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>cory:</strong> Yeah. Uh, looks like in New Hampshire, by the way, aren&#8217;t&nbsp;  </p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Corey:</strong> you in New Hampshire? I am. That&#8217;s why I&#8217;m, uh, or at least the site that it came from. Site that came from,&nbsp;  </p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>cory:</strong> yeah. Yeah. Uh, so what sticks out to me is, um, I mean, it&#8217;s one person, but it validates our second step, which is somewhere that can be used outside of the featured image.  </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Um, right. And last week we were talking about like, is there an area in the right sidebar somewhere that is, you know, you can drag it there, it&#8217;s still a step like crop it, but like then you can pull it into a Gutenberg block kind of thing. Is what, do you have any thoughts on that? Like, and I&#8217;m trying to remember a conversation from last week too.  </p>\n\n\n\n<p>I know you&#8217;re always tinkering too, so.&nbsp;  </p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Corey:</strong> Right. I, unfortunately I haven&#8217;t been this week. Um, [00:05:00] yeah. I&#8217;ve been work, like you say, life gets in the way and work is part of life, and so, yep. Uh, for those who don&#8217;t know, I, uh, consult on the side or freelance on the side and, and these are the clients I&#8217;m always talking about.  </p>\n\n\n\n<p>And so, you know, uh, we have a new design that needs to be implemented this week, so unfortunately side projects get put on, get paused. Yep. Um,&nbsp;  </p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>cory:</strong> gotta have something, pay the bills and, um, no, no. I, I just curious cause you always kinda surprise me with something. I happen to mention a circle crop and you&#8217;re like, by the way, I did it.  </p>\n\n\n\n<p>I&#8217;m like, okay, . Um, cool. What, uh, I&#8217;m gonna, I haven&#8217;t looked recently, but how many downloads are we or installs are we up to?&nbsp;  </p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Corey:</strong> Oh, good question.&nbsp;  </p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>cory:</strong> I&#8217;m gonna do that right now.  </p>\n\n\n\n<p>When I put Crop express, by the way, into the wordpress.org plugins thing. Mm-hmm. , there&#8217;s 1, [00:06:00] 2, 4, 4 things above ours, which is, I&#8217;ll have to follow up with that.&nbsp;  </p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Corey:</strong> Okay. So, so we still have fewer than 10,&nbsp;  </p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>cory:</strong> which, you know, that lags, doesn&#8217;t it? Like they have these, some metrics or something on what displays and so it could be theoretically more, I think.  </p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Corey:</strong> Yep. And am I logged in? No. Um, and I wanna say that they took away the deeper analytics. Cuz, cuz I also, you know, since we&#8217;re talking about this, I have a strong suspicion that people are also kicking the tires. Um, so I suspect that people are, you know, installing, trying it, you know, to kind of follow along in our journey and experiencing that.  </p>\n\n\n\n<p>You know, it is a limited plugin so far, and so we&#8217;re probably uninstalling it. Um, [00:07:00] so for me, like I talked about last week, this is, this is, you know, once you&#8217;re in public, this is a bit of a, um, urgency to start, like filling in those gaps. And I, I kind of personally, I like that like, there&#8217;s, there&#8217;s a lot of talk in the startup world about an entrepreneurship world in general of like, you know, if you&#8217;re not embarrassed by your first version that you released, then you&#8217;ve released too late.  </p>\n\n\n\n<p>And I, I thankfully got over that fear of releasing years ago. But it, you know, I, I think the next step is usually this, which is the, like, okay, I&#8217;m in public, I&#8217;ve told a few people about it. Yes, I&#8217;m starting to collect feedback, but I&#8217;m also, you. I can look at the product and go, oh shoot, it&#8217;s missing this.  </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Oh, I forgot about that. You know, so this is where, this is where we, we scramble as long as, uh, I, I can ,&nbsp;  </p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>cory:</strong> which is great. Like this is a good stage for, this isn&#8217;t our fa main [00:08:00] focus, but, um, I know, I know you probably have internal pressure for yourself. It&#8217;s like, I wanna get this going.&nbsp;  </p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Corey:</strong> Yeah. I mean the, the sooner we get these extra features in, the sooner we make our first million, you know, and then I don&#8217;t have to worry about client work anymore.  </p>\n\n\n\n<p>So, I mean, that&#8217;s exactly, that&#8217;s, that&#8217;s the race. The other thing that, you know, I struggle with is a bit of an adult, A D H D. And, uh, when I have a project, you know, talking or, or a little voice in my head that&#8217;s telling me this is what I wanna be working on, I have a real hard time. Doing what I&#8217;m supposed to.  </p>\n\n\n\n<p>So I&#8217;m being a good boy this week. But that&#8217;s definitely, I think part of my, if you can call it success, but at least part of my track record of launching so many things, is that for better or worse, I tend to be pretty self-indulgent and will often, you know, nights and weekends crank on something, even if it&#8217;s [00:09:00] not what I should be working on or what, yeah.  </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Uh, the people around me are happy for me to be working on, but, you know, if if it&#8217;s yelling at me loud enough, then, then I, it&#8217;s hard to resist.&nbsp;  </p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>cory:</strong> Yeah. It&#8217;s, uh, it&#8217;s hard because you can go, you can go off , just lose yourself because it&#8217;s fun, you know? But yeah. You&#8217;re talking about like 10 years for me is, is this Blitz Creek everything at it, you know.  </p>\n\n\n\n<p>This is a great pace. Like the pressure or like if we can get it, we can get it. We&#8217;re good. Kind of moving forward. But I do feel those tendencies of like, uh, you slacked me and we&#8217;re like, we got our first feedback and I was like, heck yeah. . And it&#8217;s a great one is an affirmation. Mm-hmm. . Um, so here&#8217;s what I had on my to to-do list and I&#8217;ll give you an update.  </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Um, I had Laney Page, talked to content journey, and Robbie, I did one of three. [00:10:00] I talked to Lindsay about content journey and getting their, how they source images was really fascinating. Um, I think there&#8217;s something here to that. Mm-hmm. What I wanted to talk to her more is like the more abstract thought of on page somebody land, you know, finds your post from organic traffic, whatever, and ad get on page and What&#8217;s that?  </p>\n\n\n\n<p>We had that more abstract meta conversation about the role of an image. And, uh, she gave me a lot of good feedback about how they source it. Um, they do custom stock photography, so for clients, so they&#8217;ll arrange for a photographer and they&#8217;ll do some, they do mood boards and stuff like that of like, these are the shots we want.  </p>\n\n\n\n<p>So they use a lot of those images in their posts. Um, but they&#8217;re probably, I think, using a tool like Canva. But I think still there&#8217;s a lot of validity here for crop Exactly. For the [00:11:00] theme this mm-hmm. , that perspective really illuminated for me was these themes have designs and ratios, you know, um, I&#8217;m trying&nbsp;  </p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Corey:</strong> Oh, sorry.  </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The, I&#8217;m trying to, I I received a little bit of validation. I just, I, let me interrupt you for a sec. The, the other feedback that I&#8217;m getting or, or experiential feedback or whatever is the same thing in that, uh, essentially there is, it&#8217;s almost like a style guide or you mentioned a mood board, but where there will be somebody who makes decisions about the types of images or the way images are presented.  </p>\n\n\n\n<p>So we, you had me add circles. Uh, I had a client suddenly request, uh, rounded squares [00:12:00] or round, really rounded corner squares. Um, see, that&#8217;s&nbsp;  </p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>cory:</strong> cool because that&#8217;s a, that&#8217;s a differe. Nope, that&#8217;s interesting.&nbsp;  </p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Corey:</strong> Sorry. And so, and no. Exactly, and that&#8217;s what I mean is like, you know what, we are a little bit at the mercy of what JavaScript can do and, uh, all that kind of stuff.  </p>\n\n\n\n<p>But I, I love the idea of, um, Somebody, again, making decisions about, you know, what essentially what is allowed, what, how images are allowed to be presented on a website. Um, and so I think that&#8217;s, again, going back to like I, who manage sites for clients or somebody who develops themes. And, and so within a given theme, you know, the, the op the theme was designed for images to be 16, nine, but every author photo is meant to be a square with rounded [00:13:00] corners or whatever it is.  </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Um, and so being able to lock in those, you know, we, we say here&#8217;s all the options and somebody goes in and configures all those options so that then when in your day-to-day, um, you&#8217;re, it&#8217;s a no. Editing images is, takes no brain space.&nbsp;  </p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>cory:</strong> But this the, you just. Um, I uncovered something that&#8217;s really interesting to me is like, I never thought about that.  </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Rounded corners. Mm-hmm. , like think about you kinda get a line to images, but that&#8217;s a, that little thing apart from the technical, you know, how how to do it Sure. Is. Like that&#8217;s a cool way for something to stand out and I think could be like in that pro category, uh, the pay category of stuff is like, yep.  </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The standout thing that we had kind of got into this higher conversation about us, like how to stand out. Uh, so that&#8217;s, that&#8217;s pretty cool. [00:14:00]&nbsp;  </p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Corey:</strong> Yeah, I think creative was, I think, I think we can, we can have some fun with it too. Um, potentially combined with other services or whatever. But like there&#8217;s, um, a little util we talk about, talked about utility apps.  </p>\n\n\n\n<p>There&#8217;s a little utility app that I bookmarked and go back to from time to time, which is, uh, how I created my avatar that I use everywhere. You know, you upload an image, it, I think it&#8217;ll remove the, it must remove the background for you. Like there are a lot of little single page apps that&#8217;ll do that.  </p>\n\n\n\n<p>But then it gives you, I don&#8217;t know, 40 different options of different backgrounds with sparkles or a star or circles. So it&#8217;s professional but fun. And then down below you can, they have backgrounds. So it&#8217;s you on a beach and you in front of the Eiffel Tower and yada yada. So, you know, we can. Relying on feedback and or when Corey&#8217;s a D H D kicks in [00:15:00] and wants to goof around.  </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Or if I find some new, you know, piece of code that&#8217;ll let us do this stuff. Like, I don&#8217;t, I don&#8217;t want to go too crazy with this, you know, cuz it&#8217;s, we could get goofy and end up building features that nobody wants. Right. Um, but there&#8217;s definitely some opportunity for some of these little differentiators, um, to take images, uh, within WordPress to places they haven&#8217;t been before.  </p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>cory:</strong> So, unless you have another pressing topic we should talk about, I&#8217;d like to explore that for a second. Not to say we should do it, but explore it. Sure. So that just kind of got me in a whole different, um, thought space of Okay. The round the corners thing is there and, and without technical understanding of this Sure.  </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Could you have an image and have a pull quote in front of it? You know, or something like those ways of making an image, not just, I pulled [00:16:00] that from iStock photo or Unsplash or whatever, you know? Yep. Which is interesting because like your client came to you with the rounded corners. Yep. So it&#8217;s like, how could we dress up and make those images per our conversation?  </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Like wait more. Interesting. Well, the avatar thing that&#8217;s really compelling, because maybe the tool is there&#8217;s a crop express area in the menu and you can go in and like, sure, it helps you do your featured image and eventually we&#8217;ll figure this crop where we crop it, you know? But like maybe there&#8217;s, um, that tool that, again, without technical, but I go, is that something we could do with JavaScript as a remove background or can we put some filters on mm-hmm.  </p>\n\n\n\n<p>to, or can we lay things like a slide. That&#8217;s cool options right there. That&#8217;s&nbsp;  </p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Corey:</strong> about, and, and, and what I thought you were gonna say is user images, author images, yes.&nbsp;  </p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>cory:</strong> Make like in [00:17:00] with it, you get this kick butt, like, avatar,&nbsp;  </p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Corey:</strong> right. Because we&#8217;ve got, I mean, WordPress is tied to Avatar for better or worse. And there are lots of plugins for adding user images.  </p>\n\n\n\n<p>If, you know, if in a traditional blog you have a little author byline and you wanna a little photo of them, if you don&#8217;t wanna use Gravita, there&#8217;s plugins that&#8217;ll intercept that request and, and use a WordPress image. Um, again, another place where, down the road, anywhere that somebody is interacting with images on WordPress, we wanna, you know, be there.  </p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>cory:</strong> Um, this is where Corey, I think we&#8217;re getting onto something. A bigger use case. Yep. But, um, you&#8217;ve been to Sticker Mule,&nbsp;  </p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Corey:</strong> but this is the background remover that I use generally.&nbsp;  </p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>cory:</strong> Oh, is it? Okay. This is your utility? Yes, I have one. [00:18:00] It&#8217;s almost kinda like, oh, let&#8217;s take all these things and say, can we do them technically&nbsp;  </p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Corey:</strong> upscale?  </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Read your print. Yeah. So if you Google sticker Mule background remove, um, it&#8217;s, it&#8217;s usually their background remover that I use cuz I, I love, I love Sticker Mule, I use them for swag. And so this is where, um, and, and there&#8217;s is free, like other people wanna limit the size or whatever, but these guys put it online so that with the idea that you would then go use whatever d background remover or image to print stickers.  </p>\n\n\n\n<p>So yeah. Yeah, we can start getting into that. And the, the funny thing here is I&#8217;ve been curious if this, if we&#8217;d start to have this kind of conversation, um, because the, I think I mentioned a few weeks ago, like I was messing around with another product [00:19:00] in parallel, um, based on, uh, the, the service I built takes screenshots.  </p>\n\n\n\n<p>And so it&#8217;s an API that takes screenshots, but using that a p i, it&#8217;ll, you know, people traditionally are like, oh, a screenshot of my homepage. And it&#8217;s like, okay, but you can, uh, manipulating H T M L with, and CSS is easy, relatively speaking. And then, and so you can kind of generate an image, uh, in a browser and then take a snap.  </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Right. So one of the things that I started to build as a WordPress plugin is, um, for each post, if you go to a URL off of that post, you will see the featured image with the post title and post date. And then it takes a snapshot of that or a screenshot of that. And then that&#8217;s your social image. Yeah.  </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Right. Oh&#8217;s and so, and so. It, it [00:20:00] does, I&#8217;m pretty sure it does require a third party, which is why I built this, had to build this separate a p i. Um, but you know, that&#8217;s something that I&#8217;ve already started looking at and there&#8217;s definitely ways that we could combine those things and it, and, you know, it should be a pro.  </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Definitely we&#8217;re talking about getting into pro stuff, but, um, you know, there&#8217;s, yeah, it&#8217;s lots of other areas where tentacles could creep out involving images and WordPress.&nbsp;  </p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>cory:</strong> So I&#8217;m starting both these avatars and social images with the, in the screenshots that you talked about. Yeah. Because that&#8217;s so, you know, our premise a couple weeks ago was make ch creative chores fun or easier.  </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Mm-hmm. , this is even like  </p>\n\n\n\n<p>spruce up your stuff. Like when you talk about avatar, it&#8217;s like, wow, I went and there&#8217;s a thought behind the avatar. Cuz the final [00:21:00] thing is not just a quick image and somehow slammed in there. It&#8217;s like, no, they did a circle or run, whatever these tools we could do, it&#8217;s like treatment of images, you know?  </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Right. So that&#8217;s a&nbsp;  </p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Corey:</strong> level. Yeah. And, and again, I think, you know, the, to me the, I keep coming back to this. The real value add is, The Wizbang, um, not the actual creative part, but, but locking down the creative part. So, uh, you know, I ha again, I have a website, it&#8217;s a, um, or a client website. It&#8217;s a magazine. So every, uh, article that gets submitted has a user, cuz that&#8217;s the author.  </p>\n\n\n\n<p>And so we&#8217;re up to a couple a dozen or, you know, and, and technically more. Um, but every, each one has to upload, we need to get an image from the author and then we upload it and it&#8217;s, they&#8217;re never quite [00:22:00] consistent and stuff like that. And so it&#8217;s, if we, we went in initially and decided, okay, avatar images are, even if it&#8217;s not connected necessarily to like the user profile or whatever.  </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Cuz I keep ta I like your idea of a top level menu item that&#8217;s like, here&#8217;s. Even if it&#8217;s just bookmarks that link to deeper points within WordPress. But it&#8217;s like, here, here you can manage all of your author avatars and you know, initially when you set up the site, you&#8217;d say, okay, we want them all to be square and we want them all to have, you know, rounded corners.  </p>\n\n\n\n<p>And you set that and you forget it. And so then every time a new author comes in, you know, you just say, upload image, crop it. And, and these decisions are made rather than, oh, we have a new author. I have to go back to Canva and move sliders around and try to remember, you know, what is our norm. Um, it&#8217;s&nbsp;  </p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>cory:</strong> right there.[00:23:00]&nbsp;  </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Yeah. It&#8217;s, it&#8217;s where you need it, where you&#8217;re doing the work. It&#8217;s not another platform. Yeah. Well like you&#8217;re saying, that concept is like left hand menu thing could be like that sticker mill tools. , here&#8217;s all your tools. Like, they&#8217;re not gonna need avatar every time, but they know, oh, I go back here. Go back to the utility.  </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Yep. That spruces my images up,&nbsp;  </p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Corey:</strong> you know? Yeah. I like that idea of the, the menu because it&#8217;s, I, I kind of got stuck on when you were talking about it last week. I&#8217;m like, I like it from a branding perspective, you know, but what, and, and we could, and I, I don&#8217;t have a problem with having sort of an abstract utility app built in, but I, I was like, there&#8217;s something missing.  </p>\n\n\n\n<p>And I think it&#8217;s that, like you, there&#8217;s a sub menu that says avatar, featured image, general image, or a crop to your heart&#8217;s content, you know? But,&nbsp;  </p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>cory:</strong> so here&#8217;s, here&#8217;s a question to that. [00:24:00] Um, there&#8217;s JavaScript tools and things that are available that do things. What are some of the things that, like in the libraries or out there, maybe that could connect some dots and go.  </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Is this something that could be an easy lift and maybe the utility is more pro, but I&#8217;m really li I really like that. Like when we kind of make, become the indispensable utility for sping up your images or whatever fancy thing we&#8217;re gonna call it in there. But then I just go, there&#8217;s so much locked in jQuery, JavaScript, different libraries that are probably easy reasons.  </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Like, is this remove a background feature? You know, I&#8217;m just giving. Mm-hmm. suggest like thoughts here. But if there&#8217;s some of that, it&#8217;s like, why not put that there anytime. I think the principal here could be, anytime we save them from having to go offsite site, that&#8217;s gotta be a plus one. Like that removed background thing.  </p>\n\n\n\n<p>I know the iPhone does it, [00:25:00] stuff like that. But, um, the, some of these ticker meal tools, like you, you have that book marked to do that, you know? Mm-hmm. . That&#8217;s cool. Could we. Can we pull some of those things into that library? And then I guess the question is, what are some of those low hanging fruit fruits for that?  </p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Corey:</strong> Yep, yep. I&#8217;m looking at, um, image manipulation plugins, WordPress image editor plugins, because I, you know, it&#8217;s, it, there&#8217;s, there&#8217;s features, there&#8217;s benefits, there&#8217;s ways that they come together and we can, we can offer, we can keep adding features. Eventually we will suss out whether people are using them or not.  </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Either we will build them because we get feedback or we will build them, and eventually we&#8217;ll start looking at analytics and determine that. Mm-hmm. , nobody is using the [00:26:00] watermarking tool or whatever we end. Attic, but I, Ooh. But I wanna&nbsp;  </p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>cory:</strong> watermarking, . That&#8217;s another one I&#8217;m writing down, man. Seriously.  </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Because you got all these photographers, different people, and they&#8217;re like, they wanna put their art up, but they want some sense of protection. That&#8217;s, that opens up another set of things like a whole other y uh, you know, an avatar group we can go toward, like, with just that watermark thing. Mm-hmm. . So I&#8217;m writing that down too,&nbsp;  </p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Corey:</strong> but I, what I wanna make sure the, the, the concentric circle that I wanna, or, or the middle that I wanna make sure we end up in it with.  </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Um, this is like, I&#8217;m looking at plugins where you, it&#8217;s Canva or it&#8217;s whatever image editor you like, it&#8217;s Instagram. But it&#8217;s abstract. And, [00:27:00] and I see ways that these other plugins are not, maybe not integrated the way that we are talking about integrating. Cuz that to me is the real value. Like I&#8217;d rather have fewer, this is, this is me based on my experience, right?  </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Obviously this will be determined by feedback, but I would rather have fewer features but be where it actually matters than I&#8217;m looking again at these other tools that are, I think the same, similar thing where like they&#8217;ve implemented libraries or they&#8217;ve, they&#8217;ve built a utility app and they&#8217;ve, you know, shoehorned it into WordPress, uh, like this, I don&#8217;t mean these to be derogatory phrases, um, but it&#8217;s, they are, they are potentially powerful photo editors, but they&#8217;re not where you need them to be.  </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Right? Yeah. If you, if you have to click. Into media in order to get the editor in [00:28:00] order to upload an image to then go to a post, to me, you&#8217;ve missed an opportunity cuz it&#8217;s the, I want to click on featured image or I want to click on an image block and that&#8217;s where this, you know, whatever features need to be.  </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Um, and, and that&#8217;s, and I think sussing out all those use cases to then go, okay, yes, they need watermarks or they need filters, or they need rounded corners or whatever. That&#8217;s when we start, you know, chasing all those feature lists basically. Yep.  </p>\n\n\n\n<p>All I hear is that I need to get off my butt and hurry up. And not at all, get this stuff implemented, . Not at&nbsp;  </p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>cory:</strong> all. But I, I continue to be excited as we do. Uh, really this whole product is just a dis a safari between Corey and Corey and I, I, I wrote down here. We&#8217;re building the case, you know, for it. [00:29:00] And, um, got our first feedback,  </p>\n\n\n\n<p>there&#8217;s a point where we&#8217;re gonna have to say, okay, we think we&#8217;re onto something. And I guess the two ways I think about this one is just put it in a pro version and get somebody to buy. That&#8217;s validation. Second is, hey, does all this resonate? If, so here&#8217;s a, like a, it&#8217;s not a Kickstarter, but a Kickstarter thing of like, buy a hundred dollars, you know, we need 10 grand, let&#8217;s say, to chase these features that we&#8217;re gonna do that we&#8217;ve heard and come in, we&#8217;ll give you some special thing by being one of the first.  </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Yep. So that&#8217;s another option, but I&#8217;m just throwing stuff out like. That&#8217;s a good idea because I feel like we&#8217;re starting to really build a case and we&#8217;re gonna need to make some actual decisions here pretty soon of going, we think this is it, but level of effort for [00:30:00] two hobby workers here doing this, it&#8217;s gonna require capital to go get, get the developer plus more time, you know, to, to chase some of these&nbsp;  </p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Corey:</strong> mm-hmm.  </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Yep. So, yeah, there&#8217;s definitely a, I There&#8217;ll&nbsp;  </p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>cory:</strong> be a catalytic moment. I&#8217;m sorry, there&#8217;ll be a CATA for sure. Moment. You know, we keep coming back soon and&nbsp;  </p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Corey:</strong> we&#8217;re soon there&#8217;s, there&#8217;s op we&#8217;re, we&#8217;re coming at it from opposite ends. Mm-hmm. . Um, we have, I think in the, in some of our discussions, we&#8217;ve established a baseline of functionality that&#8217;s on my plate and then we&#8217;re having really good high level conversations that are.  </p>\n\n\n\n<p>It&#8217;s, you know, you&#8217;re building a house, you know, you need a basement or a a, a cement slab. That&#8217;s Corey&#8217;s job right now. But it&#8217;s, and, and it&#8217;s not without its interesting challenges or [00:31:00] fun points of creativity, but you and I are, at the end of the day, each opening a beer proverbially and standing back and going, okay, so do we wanna build a widows walk?  </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Do we want, uh, a hot tub? Do we want, um, you know, uh, a fireman&#8217;s pole? And s and right now is the time to have all those conversations. Cuz we&#8217;re like, oh, well, uh, I live in New Hampshire hot tub, you can only use about three months of the year. Not that people don&#8217;t have them, but you know, oh, we use&nbsp;  </p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>cory:</strong> ours. , I use ours, I should say.  </p>\n\n\n\n<p>I&#8217;m like, okay, it&#8217;s five degrees, but ,&nbsp;  </p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Corey:</strong> it&#8217;s hot out there. .&nbsp;  </p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>cory:</strong> Yeah. That maybe warrants some of this, cuz I think we&#8217;re building a case enough where I ki kind of go, okay man, it but it almost si to me and I wanna get your opinions on this. Here&#8217;s free. It&#8217;s got us enough to like really get to talking. Some [00:32:00] people are kind of using it and then going like some of these things.  </p>\n\n\n\n<p>I&#8217;m like, yeah. Then we just take down there. There&#8217;s a general thought or direction here. It&#8217;s like anything where you have to go offsite. Let&#8217;s think about that. Let&#8217;s think about watermark, social engine, screenshots, avatars, that&#8217;s all like paid features. Yeah, those are paid things.&nbsp;  </p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Corey:</strong> Yeah. But I like your idea of,&nbsp;  </p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>cory:</strong> that&#8217;s why, by the way, I&#8217;m glad you got that other domain, ,&nbsp;  </p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Corey:</strong> too many domains.  </p>\n\n\n\n<p>I in I, that one I own actually brought me up to 20, which is way down. I used to have. You know, a hundred or something. But we need to&nbsp;  </p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>cory:</strong> buy domain support group separate from this, cuz I&#8217;m with you. Um, but the, the domain you did get, I go, that&#8217;s probably where it seems like right now, today as we&#8217;ve talked about these options, that&#8217;s where we&#8217;re, we&#8217;re probably gonna land.  </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Yeah. Um, [00:33:00] so, uh, sorry, so what are your thoughts on like, I&#8217;ve, I&#8217;m feeling excited. I don&#8217;t wanna get it, but, you know, beyond our skis here, but I go man, one of these, you start with one domino, the second into a pro feature set. Um, we still don&#8217;t have a ton of users, which is what we need. Right. Well, I need&nbsp;  </p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Corey:</strong> to finish thoughts on that again.  </p>\n\n\n\n<p>I need to finish the slab. I need to finish the baseline version that is, Because the other thing I wanna be careful of, and, and we&#8217;re gonna have to, as usual 10, 10 thoughts, thought threads at once here. But I am glad that we are talking about these other directions because I want, what we can&#8217;t do is [00:34:00] have a plugin that is, um,&nbsp;  </p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>cory:</strong> what are you looking at  </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Uh, if you heard somebody yelling, that&#8217;s my dad, ,&nbsp;  </p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Corey:</strong> um, what we, what we can&#8217;t have is a free version that is useless. Yeah. Right. Okay. Is, or, or that, that hint set, you know, features but doesn&#8217;t actually deliver. And so I kind of have a feeling. , what we had originally talked about was like pro features that are specifically for, uh, agencies, stuff like that.  </p>\n\n\n\n<p>But I have a feeling that even the non-technical or non-agency user is going to need like half of the pro features and great, we, it would be great if we could sell it to them, but if it, if it&#8217;s useless without those features, you know, we, [00:35:00] we see, we see too much churn. Yeah. And so if, if we can even make a pro version that&#8217;s cheap, that just adds a little bit of icing, but then we can use all of this as a segue into these other bigger solving, these other bigger problems than we start to build an empire.  </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Um, which is very, uh, exciting. You know, if we. We start to get into, if there&#8217;s an uh, you know, WordPress and plugins and their add-ons, if there&#8217;s an avatar add-on, if there&#8217;s a social media image add-on mm-hmm. different from the core pro, which is only, you know, 10 bucks to add, you know, color pickers or something, you know, that, that feels better to me than trying to sell or trying to get people to use a free version that only works for us.  </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Very small percentage. Yeah. And then [00:36:00] expect everybody to pay a hundred bucks. They&#8217;re just not gonna, yeah. Thank,&nbsp;  </p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>cory:</strong> thanks for anchor this. It needs to be a step, we need to work back on to the slab. So when you said that it came little kind of clear to me is like, maybe it&#8217;s just that area, you know, below the featured image.  </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Uh, I don&#8217;t know if that&#8217;s where it should go in the ui, but it seems like that one thing could flesh out. And maybe there&#8217;s even, like, maybe that&#8217;s where custom dimensions comes into. Mm-hmm. Here it is, all your cropping. You don&#8217;t have to go somewhere else, you don&#8217;t have to upgrade, but like, it&#8217;s the free mvp.  </p>\n\n\n\n<p>It&#8217;s the, uh, not mvp. It&#8217;s the value prop is just want to get the right sized images, you know, done easily without having to find all these different workflows. It&#8217;s right here sitting for you as a utility right there [00:37:00] in right sidebar, post and page. What do you think?&nbsp;  </p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Corey:</strong> Yeah, I see that like it&#8217;s, uh, basically going in a, going in a different dimension.  </p>\n\n\n\n<p>It&#8217;s, it&#8217;s all of the features, but only in limited places as opposed to some of the features everywhere. All of the features everywhere. Yeah. So, yeah, we can, we can, we can look at that kind of configuration. I think it, to me, that&#8217;s. , the way I often design product is by building, as we&#8217;ve talked about. And so I think that that&#8217;s the sort of thing that&#8217;s going to become self pretty self apparent as I&#8217;m building.  </p>\n\n\n\n<p>And then you and I can either have one of these calls or can talk in Slack as I&#8217;m going. Okay, so we&#8217;ve, we&#8217;ve covered our bases. We have that cement slab. What is, what does this first floor look like? Do I build three stories of one room or do I build one story of three rooms? Mm-hmm. . Mm-hmm. . And so we can [00:38:00] decide whether we want to kind of go up or go out.  </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Um, so, you know, so what feels good and what, how much feedback we have&nbsp;  </p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>cory:</strong> at the time. Absolutely. And what clarity I see now up for your feedback is we have some case for. A bigger utility that goes, dives deeper into like the avatar. So there&#8217;s the screenshot thing. You blew my mind for a second. But you go into social images, you go into water marketing.  </p>\n\n\n\n<p>So we&#8217;ve got a case building here for pro and then you anchored us back to free full. A full featured free, I think is what I take from this. And that makes me think that free tool needs to be inside bar and it needs to have custom dimensions. Mm-hmm. . Because then why would you want to go anywhere else?  </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Like, cuz somebody could conceivably say, well it&#8217;s letting me crop and get the crop, you know, images, but I want them to a little different. Then they&#8217;re still having to go out. But if we just think only featured free, I [00:39:00] go, that&#8217;s it To me. I go put it in the sidebar. Custom dimensions we&#8217;re good, but again, I&#8217;m, I&#8217;m positing this, I just  </p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Corey:</strong> custom dimensions. I think that&#8217;s where. Okay. Because I think it&#8217;s necessary. I think that that&#8217;s the, you know, you we&#8217;re, without it, we&#8217;re talking about, I don&#8217;t know, a car without gas or something. Mm-hmm. . It just doesn&#8217;t, it just doesn&#8217;t do enough. We can&#8217;t, I can&#8217;t imagine that the vast majority of websites only use Square or 16.9 and subsequently we&#8217;re gonna cover our bases.  </p>\n\n\n\n<p>I think it&#8217;s, um, cuz we also, I think, want to hint at that additional value prop of agencies of locking down your website, even from yourself. So the settings page. [00:40:00] Yeah. If you want to allow certain sizes or aspect ratios that are not 16, nine or square, you have to click, click, click to go over to the settings page.  </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Now you set it once and you forget it. But it&#8217;s over there. Whereas day to day you&#8217;re going in and you&#8217;re going, well, my website is actually 16 1.6 that&#8217;s already configured, and then day-to-day, I&#8217;m just plugging in in images.&nbsp;  </p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>cory:</strong> So it seems like, like I&#8217;m trying to remember back to like the Photoshop CRO tool.  </p>\n\n\n\n<p>You get the little window over here that&#8217;s, you can type in pixels wide, pixels tall. Then you have an aspect ratio that could be tweaked potentially. Yeah. Like to me, man, if that&#8217;s like maybe the, there&#8217;s the preset, click it go. Just try to get &#8217;em fast. The crop. Then there&#8217;s, in that window, when it pulls up, there&#8217;s, maybe it&#8217;s an advanced tab or something, but it&#8217;s [00:41:00] conceptual.  </p>\n\n\n\n<p>I&#8217;m just kind of talking, but it&#8217;s like those little, that little Photoshop box. If you want to go custom, here you go. And then you can click crop and it&#8217;s done. Yep. Okay. If that&#8217;s it. What, what do you think the level ever for that is? Because I don&#8217;t wanna say Corey, could you do that for us? But I just wanna say, what do you think?  </p>\n\n\n\n<p>That level of effort, because man, right, with that is, okay, beachhead product is crop the pro then become, this is a path into pro. You do this, by the way, so here&#8217;s the panacea for those of you that needs this over here, it&#8217;s called mm-hmm. , our domain. Um, so what&#8217;s level, level of&nbsp;  </p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Corey:</strong> effort you think for that?  </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Uh, it&#8217;s, it&#8217;s honestly, I ha it&#8217;s built already. I had to rip it out, um, to submit the free version because we had talked about, I love working with developers, , um, you know, keeping it very simple. Yeah. Just getting a proof of concept out the door. So, uh, [00:42:00] you know, cuz that, that&#8217;s, to me, even thinking about the 0 0 1 version, we, I knew we would need custom.  </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Configuration. So, um, so putting in a simple settings page and allowing, uh, some basic, you know, one or two presets essentially gets us there. Um,&nbsp;  </p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>cory:</strong> okay. So, so if I capture this right though, so they would activate plugin and set those in the plugin settings tab and then have &#8217;em available when that rat sidebar thing comes up, or did I get that wrong?  </p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Corey:</strong> No, that, I mean, that was how I imagined it initially. Okay. Uh, but I, as we&#8217;ve talked about, or I talked about I two or three sessions ago, I also think that we need an option to bypass. Um, like we don&#8217;t want to truly [00:43:00] 100% Absolutely. Lock somebody out of uploading an image that&#8217;s some goofy size and shape, like that&#8217;s just root.  </p>\n\n\n\n<p>It&#8217;s your, it&#8217;s their website. So, in. So in my mind, the flow that we&#8217;ve proposed is setting up a new site or you have a site, you install the plugin, you&#8217;d go and say, this site uses or will use 16 1.6 aspect ratio images save. And then when I, whenever I try to upload a featured image, it&#8217;ll, it&#8217;s an option.  </p>\n\n\n\n<p>It&#8217;ll default to that. But there will also, which right now we&#8217;re lacking. But there is so an advanced button that says, do whatever the hell you want. Or just, yeah, blunt. Upload a 10,000 pixel image. Even though we don&#8217;t recommend that you do that. So the&nbsp;  </p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>cory:</strong> reason why I&#8217;m asking some of these in depth, cuz if I get the workflow in my head and I know how it goes, I, that&#8217;s where I&#8217;d like to, here&#8217;s your workflow, here it is, you know, [00:44:00] and we&#8217;re gonna do our best in the product side to make it really easy and safe.  </p>\n\n\n\n<p>But that&#8217;s really helpful cuz I&#8217;d go. Hey, it&#8217;s here in the settings page, but you can also, when you&#8217;re popping it up, crop it to what you think. Right? But if they&#8217;re like me, I go, I don&#8217;t know how far this is. I don&#8217;t, you know, I don&#8217;t know how wide single post templates are typically, I guess like 400, 500.  </p>\n\n\n\n<p>But, so that&#8217;s really, really awesome cuz there&#8217;s like, if you&#8217;re the agency, you&#8217;re gonna set it in the plugin. It&#8217;s there for &#8217;em. If you&#8217;re the independent professional using it, trying to publish content, you might use this at some point, but you got this flexibility. That&#8217;s, that&#8217;s&nbsp;  </p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Corey:</strong> brilliant. And I think, uh, we will do two things.  </p>\n\n\n\n<p>We will have, and this is similar to a lot of other plugins that have this pattern, and I think it&#8217;s, I think it&#8217;s a winner, is you have a settings page. So [00:45:00] you&#8217;ve gone non-developers, but you also allow those settings to be. Hmm. Locked in by defining constants in your WP config file. So it&#8217;s the kind of thing where, uh, you know, um, WP Migrate DB Pro, um, or a c F or there&#8217;s a bunch of other plugins that do this, where you&#8217;ve, uh, you can go in and fiddle with things, or Corey the developer, sets up a new site, drops in a couple of the same constants on all of the sites, and so there&#8217;s no messing with a settings page.  </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Things are just defined. Um, and so we can do a, uh, we can normalize it that way too. So&nbsp;  </p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>cory:</strong> I&#8217;m gonna follow up with Kathy&#8217;s aunt over at Cadence to talk this through, but there, we&#8217;ve, we&#8217;ve hit it because the free tool will say, [00:46:00] this is what I heard. I&#8217;m a web development design firm, agency developer, whatever else.  </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Um, I create, go to all this pain to create this great site for someone and then they end up probably bettering because the images is a wild, wild west in their workflow is like, we&#8217;re gonna use cadence or whatever theme framework, Hey, go here. This is gonna protect your beautiful project you just delivered to the client.  </p>\n\n\n\n<p>That&#8217;s killer man. Yeah. And just making it like it&#8217;s a free tool, you know? And by the way, at some point there&#8217;s gonna be this other thing. So like we get &#8217;em here, use this on all your client sites. So that&#8217;s the u free utility version. Help people. That&#8217;s our, I think that&#8217;s our angle into building the user base for this is, Hey everybody, raise your hand if you had a client.  </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Who takes your beautiful project and screws it up with images. [00:47:00] Yep. Okay. This crop express helps put some little guardrails, like bowling, put the guardrails out so it doesn&#8217;t bounce into the gutter. Yep. I think we&#8217;ve just like stumbled into really compelling to this process. Um, way to go, like we&#8217;re being opinionated, you know, you telling me like themes said, I was like going back to my theme days going, yeah, you&#8217;re right.  </p>\n\n\n\n<p>They designed us with specific things to make sure it lights up like the demo site does, but then in the tool, in the software itself, , it&#8217;s all over the place. It breaks, it makes it&nbsp;  </p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Corey:</strong> look ugly and, and here&#8217;s a little like silly little thing, but low lift may be valuable is I&#8217;m picturing content journey who are writers.  </p>\n\n\n\n<p>And content people, but who are, maybe some of them at [00:48:00] least are not going to be artistic or not going to be comfortable in Photoshop or what have you. Right. So they will, they might be sourcing images. I&#8217;m trying to, I&#8217;m thinking on my feet here, so obviously I&#8217;m stumbling a little, but like my clients too, they go and they source images and I have taught them that we use, we need an image that within that image, whatever size shape it is, there needs to be a 16 nine and there needs to be a square cuz the one of the sites specifically uses that.  </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Right. But they&#8217;ve had to learn that and I&#8217;ve had to teach that to them. And so imagine this, again, silly little thing, but I, I kind of am in love with this idea at the moment. I love where you&#8217;re going. Is uh, it, once you hit settings or once you set those things, it auto generates a style [00:49:00] guide, documentation or what have you.  </p>\n\n\n\n<p>You know, and, and I think this can keep going, but like, again, the quick and easy is I install Crop Express. I set it, I, the developer set it so that the, the website allows this and, you know, 16, nine and square both need to be 10,000 or, or 2000 or less, which is the plug-in will or take advantage of, but it generates some sort of documentation or reference material that I can then hand the client and say, you know, not so, so it doesn&#8217;t rely on them to have to learn or have to figure this stuff out.  </p>\n\n\n\n<p>They have. A thing upfront that says, okay, here&#8217;s what you need when you go to Unsplash affiliate link. When you go to Stock Unlimited affiliate link, you know, these are the, this is what you need to be looking for, this is how you download it, et cetera, et cetera. [00:50:00]&nbsp;  </p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>cory:</strong> I love it because you&#8217;re teaching in the software, you&#8217;re guiding in not just programmatically, but like, that&#8217;s content heaven right there, because conceptually settings page when they&#8217;re doing, or there&#8217;s a, some kind of quick, you know, setup and it&#8217;s like, that&#8217;s our lead magnet two.  </p>\n\n\n\n<p>It&#8217;s like, hey, here&#8217;s the five best places. Uh, here&#8217;s some th like the thoughts we&#8217;ve done on how to like source an image. We, you and I could probably rough some of that out and like, you want it, you know, and journalism is like, you don&#8217;t want the person looking off the page. , you know, so like there&#8217;s some tips we could put in there and that could become guidance and lead magnet&nbsp;  </p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Corey:</strong> and like, yep.  </p>\n\n\n\n<p>And we let, let developers white label it so they put their own logo. And so Corey gets paid to set up a website. I set up a website, install a theme, install crop express, plug in [00:51:00] the hardcode, what I know will, will work and, and match a best practice. Click a button that then downloads the documentation that I need, that I can then hand the client so that, you know, it makes my life easier.  </p>\n\n\n\n<p>I don&#8217;t have to teach them anything. Ooh. And, and maybe that is powerful. Maybe, maybe I, it lets me put my logo in there instead of crop express. So I&#8217;m now handing Corey branded material to the client who I just built a website for.&nbsp;  </p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>cory:</strong> I just think I need to go, I put another name on my list, which is I need to talk to Kimberly at ballet.  </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Because all these companies that do agencies that do maintenance and stuff, you&#8217;re like, Hey, make this better. You know? Like, this will make it better. They&#8217;re, they&#8217;ll actually size images correctly. You can do the things you&#8217;re talking about cuz you&#8217;re thinking about the white label, which normally in the past I put into pro.  </p>\n\n\n\n<p>It&#8217;s like, well, that&#8217;s when you get into pro. But I love it here because it&#8217;s like [00:52:00] when you go to a developer, you can just do this and it&#8217;s gonna be better. And they go, heck yeah, because I don&#8217;t have to do all the work and the, I&#8217;m gonna get the benefit from that for my client. Now we&#8217;re, now we&#8217;re here, now we&#8217;re hitting huge case study for free and Pro.  </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Mm-hmm. . Yep. That&#8217;s, that&#8217;s brilliant man. So, okay, so the, what I got is right sidebar custom dimensions. And maybe a third for downstream is like, do we do this white labeling thing? But I&#8217;ll put the third, uh, that&#8217;ll be fourth. I&#8217;ll put the third is, and this will be on me. Uh, I&#8217;ll need some help from you.  </p>\n\n\n\n<p>But it is like collecting these, here&#8217;s your five sources. Mm-hmm. , you know, here&#8217;s, you can find and source good, good stuff. And I could turn into, lead back to our blog on the site [00:53:00] that at some point goes, we&#8217;re gonna talk about open ai, this source. Like, hey, that&#8217;s a webinar you and I can do. Just playing around with stuff.  </p>\n\n\n\n<p>I&#8217;ve been talking to Ag Mors about this, like, maybe we spend a webinar, we&#8217;re like talking about how to cool, create cool images for your blog post using Dolly, or whatever it is. Mm-hmm. great content. Get the people attracted that we need. Tell &#8217;em we&#8217;re trying to make their life better. Like, that&#8217;s the, that&#8217;s the, that&#8217;s the game right there.  </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Like, yeah. Okay, let me, let me record this right side dimensions, some of the EDU guidance content that&#8217;s me. And then downstream, I think is what label, unless  </p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Corey:</strong> I mean just, you know, there&#8217;s, there&#8217;s complicated ways to do it and easy ways to do it. And so we can start with the easy way of no branding or what have you. And here&#8217;s content. Yeah. [00:54:00] Um, I worked with valet a few years ago and one of the things that they were working hard on was the conceptual.  </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Literature and illustration of the value they provided every month. Um, and came up with, I have t-shirts that have the design on them, but, um, the illustrated, you know, here&#8217;s what we do for you every month, because that is something that agencies who who run retainers have to, you wanna stay top of mind.  </p>\n\n\n\n<p>You don&#8217;t want just invoices to roll in without a client going, wait, what did, what did you do in the last 30 days? Or what did you do in the last year? Um, Chris Lema had a great blog post about this years ago, um, that I took away from, uh, for my conbon plugin was send, you know, between purchasing and renewal, I [00:55:00] automated 12 emails.  </p>\n\n\n\n<p>That of generic content, valuable, but generic content, evergreen, I should say, content. So at month eight it would say, okay, you are eight months into using your CONBON plugin. By now you are an expert. Here are some advanced tips, or whatever it was. Um, and so, you know, if we can give agencies content to hand to their clients, it&#8217;s obviously not necessarily month over month, but that kind of content.  </p>\n\n\n\n<p>You know, I&#8217;m teaching you, I&#8217;m helping you use your website to its fullest, all that kind of stuff. I, you know, again, I, I think it, it will resonate with some people. Yep.&nbsp;  </p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>cory:</strong> Uh, championing the cause, helping people, guiding them, walking with them. It&#8217;s good stuff.&nbsp;  </p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Corey:</strong> But all that to say, I think, yeah, Kim at Valet would is a great person.  </p>\n\n\n\n<p>I know that they were working on that. I mean, it was years ago now, but, [00:56:00] um, you know, see where she&#8217;s at and, and see that it resonates with her or doesn&#8217;t, but. Okay.  </p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>cory:</strong> I think Kathy, uh, I&#8217;ll try to ping Kathy this week. If I can get to it today. I&#8217;ll ping her to get the conversation. I&#8217;ve got other things to talk about or talk with her anyway and talk about this cuz if we can like get on a tr get on somebody&#8217;s that&#8217;s, that&#8217;s a Cadillac moment potentially. Plus being able to, sorry, go ahead.  </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Just being able to say this is how the theme will look best and this tool&#8217;s gonna help you with that. Huge. Yeah. And&nbsp;  </p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Corey:</strong> I, I would love to make sure that that&#8217;s true. Because as I&#8217;ve discussed a little bit, I, I primarily use a page builder, which lets anybody upload anything anywhere on the page. Different from what [00:57:00] I conventionally thought of with themes, which was I buy a realtor theme that is already preconfigured for a realtor.  </p>\n\n\n\n<p>So when I click install theme it autoinject fake content with fake realtor pages and fake listings and all that, you know. Does that where between the block editor and the block editor being used for full site editing and page builders and these big theme frameworks or, you know, uh, just shy of a page builder type theme.  </p>\n\n\n\n<p>I want to make sure that that&#8217;s the use case we&#8217;re talking about is still true. Mm-hmm. . In which case, it&#8217;s not like I, you know, we could make a module for Elementor or Beaver Builder, and then it&#8217;s on the [00:58:00] shoulders of the person setting up the website to install those modules and then set those, you know, we want, we wanna allow 16, nine images or whatever it is, which I think is a different use case than my neighbor who&#8217;s a realtor.  </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Mm-hmm. , who installs a plugin and it&#8217;s the, or ex installs a theme. And the theme is preconfigured with our, to work with our plugin to, to say, you know, I have already built all these layouts that are, that encourage that, that only really work best with 16 not, does that make sense? Like, oh yeah.&nbsp;  </p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>cory:</strong> Yeah. It&#8217;s so.  </p>\n\n\n\n<p>So thinking ahead&nbsp;  </p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Corey:</strong> to them, talk your, your theme people and make sure that this assumption is correct.&nbsp;  </p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>cory:</strong> Yeah, we&#8217;ll just get on the, see where that alignment is. But my hunch is like, I think it&#8217;s Ben over at Cadence, but as they&#8217;re, whoever designs [00:59:00] their themes, actually, I think it&#8217;s Sailor now, but whoever design their themes, like if you could wish that they would fill it with images that really glorify your theme, what would that be?  </p>\n\n\n\n<p>That&#8217;s the question, right? You know,&nbsp;  </p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Corey:</strong> and or, and or we&#8217;re talking about, you know, if, if you are, because if a theme gives total freedom like a page builder, where, where does it make sense to lock down images? Because Corey comes into a blank slate. It&#8217;s up to me to decide. Okay. You know, or, or I had a client who, um, it&#8217;s a, um, Asian American themed website.  </p>\n\n\n\n<p>And so they originally wanted images that were, um, slightly vertical based on the Japanese mats that people sleep on. Apparently, they are a standard aspect ratio, and so [01:00:00] I don&#8217;t think anybody has ever looked at the website and, and got the reference. But, you know, they wanted, so it&#8217;s, again, it is like, you know, four instead of a four, three aspect ratio, it&#8217;s four, 3.7, but that would&#8217;ve been decided by the designer and or me, not the theme creator.  </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Mm-hmm. . So anyway, I&#8217;m just, I&#8217;m, and I, I have no idea what the theme landscape looks like these days.&nbsp;  </p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>cory:</strong> It&#8217;s something I can, I can add some of our agency owners too. It&#8217;s like, What, what tools are they doing to build websites and things like that? I still take it, especially on the boutique level, they&#8217;re using some framework like a Cadence Generat press, an AOR or Beaver builder to, to build that.  </p>\n\n\n\n<p>So if we can, I love this cuz it&#8217;s just, we&#8217;re just talking about the workflow, which you&#8217;ve done right? You specifically have done so you know that and that&#8217;s, [01:01:00] yeah, that&#8217;s good stuff. Okay, so plan is get, get to the full feature set for free  </p>\n\n\n\n<p>and I&#8217;ll talk to these people and then we&#8217;ve, we&#8217;re building this really cool case for being that utility. Oh, everything&#8217;s here. Then we can start talking about where that, like tools here, but there&#8217;s, does it need to be integrated here? Like when you say social images, does it need to be somewhere, again, not technically speaking here, but conceptually is like, Yost has social images that needs to tie into here.  </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Um, man, we&#8217;re, I think we&#8217;re onto something. I really do. And it&#8217;s not just blind optimism and because we&#8217;re having fun doing this. I think we&#8217;re getting, we&#8217;re really building this case.&nbsp;  </p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Corey:</strong> Well, and I, the other thing, I think the good plan that has evolved, yes. And, and I think we are building, [01:02:00] people talk about authority and this is how you build authority.  </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Like you, you get an idea for a product or a problem you want to solve, and then you start splashing around at it, you know? Yeah. I hadn&#8217;t thought about image cropping really, because I am comfortable in Photoshop and Yep. And then I, after a while I got lazy and so started using, you know, a different program or found a website that did it and it was good enough, but I was never.  </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Thinking deeply about cropping images other than I needed to, I need, I need this done, this task done, and now it&#8217;s done. And then I quick upload it and off we go. Whereas now we are, we are becoming the experts, uh, on cropping images, manipulating images, WordPresses relationship with images, themes, images, plugins, da da da da da da da.  </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Um, and that&#8217;s where, down the road, [01:03:00] you know, I, I, I have, I have a lot of fun with this, this part of the process. And down the road we become, you know, the image expert guys, the crop expert guys. The, it&#8217;s all of our marketing content. Go ahead.&nbsp;  </p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>cory:</strong> Oh, no, no, no, no. You&#8217;re, yeah, I was, yes, you&#8217;re on the thing. Uh, the next thing I was gonna say, you&#8217;re leading straight into it.  </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Do, um, do you mind if we talk publicly about the domain? No, of course not. Okay. So, You&#8217;re leading into this . I was trying to be like not, not as excited. So I could&nbsp;  </p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Corey:</strong> finish, wait, hold this statement. Should we It is, it is th uh, 1 0 5. Should we save the discussion till next week?  </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Yes, you can say no .&nbsp;  </p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>cory:</strong> Okay. I wanna say no because I think it&#8217;s just real quick. It&#8217;s just a thought that we&#8217;ll come back to. Mm-hmm. for sure. For direction. We built this case and everything, so I go, crop Express is the free [01:04:00] plugin, but the domain is the brand. Mm. So like if you think about business and marketing wise, we got this one thing, but we&#8217;re making this case for, and how would you say the domain It&#8217;s&nbsp;  </p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Corey:</strong> unfortunately, so it&#8217;s image img.express.  </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Okay.&nbsp;  </p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>cory:</strong> So to me, it seems like we just got this clear path, like we&#8217;re building this case and I go, it needs to be crop express by. I m g Express because we just placed this discovered, backed into, here&#8217;s the free utility. There&#8217;s a bigger case here, but it&#8217;s by this brand Corey and Corey, the I m G Express guys.  </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Yep. You know, so I kind of tend to think like when we&#8217;re ready doesn&#8217;t have to happen. Now is like, because all roads we want to lead to, we did this just to get your attention to a beachhead and then, but we&#8217;re the [01:05:00] IMG guys, right? From a branding business&nbsp;  </p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Corey:</strong> perspective, we are, we are all things image.&nbsp;  </p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>cory:</strong> Yep.  </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Because we&#8217;ve got these use guys. We know we&#8217;ve got some, some, some, we got something here. Um, that is a, could be packaged together and sold for a good price that could sustain and support this business. So that, that&#8217;s the only thing I wanted to say. We don&#8217;t have to finalize that, but I just go man, that that&#8217;s clarity.  </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Of like, it&#8217;s the Im g guys, and by the way, we&#8217;re known like, this is a great utility. Everybody should use it. We do it free because you, you need it, people need it. This is gonna make the web better. When you get to the advanced stuff and you really want to go next level, look what we&#8217;re doing here. And that&#8217;s where you come into the community as Im g community, as professionals doing this work.  </p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Corey:</strong> Yeah. I mean, the obvious, uh, parallel that comes to mind is like sayed at doing WP [01:06:00] Beginner. Mm-hmm. Where WP G beginner, uh, I don&#8217;t, I, it runs ads. I suppose I&#8217;m, I&#8217;m sure there&#8217;s some way that it makes money, but for the most part it&#8217;s just a phenomenal resource.&nbsp;  </p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>cory:</strong> Yeah. It&#8217;s hub free content. It&#8217;s the Osmo Automotive Hub for everything they.  </p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Corey:</strong> Right. And obviously they, they use it to promote their products and stuff like that, but I end up on their website all the time learning things. I scroll to the bottom where they usually have a code, version, um, to solve whatever little problem I&#8217;m trying to, to solve. But, um, you know, to me we&#8217;re, we&#8217;re kind of following that same path.  </p>\n\n\n\n<p>If we get people using Crop Express often and and using that for, um, as a reference for other things, then yeah, you know, we can, we can kind of go in any direction really. So, I&nbsp;  </p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>cory:</strong> already put another domain thought about this and I didn&#8217;t wanna do it [01:07:00] publicly just yet cuz we don&#8217;t have the domain secured for it, but I was like, and, and I&#8217;ll totally buy that one.  </p>\n\n\n\n<p>But, um, I was like, you think about IMG and stuff. But yes. Sorry, back to I got, I got squirreled, sorry. But back to this. You&#8217;re fine. , we&#8217;re, we&#8217;re building the case. We&#8217;re creating this resource. You and I are passionate about this kind of stuff. We&#8217;ve got extensive experience, even if we weren&#8217;t the person, we&#8217;ve, we&#8217;ve done these things and it feels very natural to be like, that&#8217;s the brand.  </p>\n\n\n\n<p>This is our, and I wouldn&#8217;t have had that clarity two months ago, by the way.&nbsp;  </p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Corey:</strong> Right, right. It&#8217;s, yeah. You know, we are waiting deeper and deeper into the pr and it&#8217;s, it&#8217;s also where you start to, you know, the edges become less amorphous. Mm-hmm. You know, the , uh, uh, but you also start to see the rise in . Yeah.  </p>\n\n\n\n<p>But it&#8217;s, you know, you, [01:08:00] you&#8217;re stepping foot in, into, you know, all new territory. And I mean, we&#8217;re gonna keep having these conversations, uh, and especially. Upfront because we&#8217;re not getting a lot of feedback. We are doing our own exploration, which also involves like, you know, there&#8217;s, there&#8217;s lots of writing and whatnot about we are, we are having biased conversations, right?  </p>\n\n\n\n<p>We are going, you are, you are going to content journey with a solution looking for a problem if we&#8217;re honest mm-hmm. . Mm-hmm. . Um, we&#8217;re not, we are open to them saying what we really need is X, Y, Z. But you know, that&#8217;s where we&#8217;re at. Because right now all we can do is make assumptions.&nbsp;  </p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>cory:</strong> I did try just so you know, to not do problem first and ask somebody, oh sure.  </p>\n\n\n\n<p>How do you do it? And that was a gold mine, just like this guy mentioned. He&#8217;s like, okay. That&#8217;s validating of, we&#8217;re not trying to just say, I&#8217;ve got a hammer. Where&#8217;s your nail? Um, [01:09:00] that&#8217;s good stuff, man. It&#8217;s, it&#8217;s been fun walking with you and this is a good, like, I think we needed each other to kind of, Get to this part.  </p>\n\n\n\n<p>And it just feels better than, honestly, better than any product I&#8217;ve done because we&#8217;re, we had less pressure. We thought it served our need and we started exploring how it is, and it, it just feels like we&#8217;re on the right path. Yeah, for sure. This could be something, man.&nbsp;  </p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Corey:</strong> And it&#8217;s, and I, I&#8217;m really selfishly, I&#8217;m excited to see where we end up in a year, maybe nowhere, who knows, but to then come back and visit these conversations cuz these are always the, you know, what is it, you know, you did.  </p>\n\n\n\n<p>You make a, you make a plan, and then halfway through executing the plan, you&#8217;re like, why did we decide&nbsp;  </p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>cory:</strong> to do this? See, I thought that was the only one. Like, yeah, nobody comes over. [01:10:00] Most people, I should say, don&#8217;t have the fully crystallized, baked out plan. So much of product is expiration like this, right?  </p>\n\n\n\n<p>I think the people, honestly, I&#8217;m side baring and squiring on this, but like the people that kind of think they got the perfect thing, I go one, you might be a genius. Cool. Congratulations. Number two, you&#8217;re probably pretty rare the rest of us trying&nbsp;  </p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Corey:</strong> to figure it out. Yep, yep. And I mean, and time March is on, like I was, somebody asked on Twitter, uh, I don&#8217;t remember what happened to your first product or something.  </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Um, and, and I was like, I, I got up to, through, through the discussion, I was like, I got up to thousands of users but could never figure out how to monetize and. And the person I was talking with was like, I, that, that&#8217;s how, how, how is that possible? Mm-hmm. . And it&#8217;s like, well it was email-based. It was a product, so [01:11:00] you couldn&#8217;t really run ads, which was his good suggestion.  </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Um, it was a product for people who had no money, , so you don&#8217;t wanna sell to people who have no money. Um, you know, and, and the technology of sending lots of emails was expensive and all this stuff. So it was like, there were all these things at the time, whereas, I could build it better now for much cheaper and could probably figure out how to monetize based on new patterns that have emerged and stuff like that.  </p>\n\n\n\n<p>So there&#8217;s, you know, there&#8217;s, there&#8217;s all of those dimensions. Like even if you&#8217;re a genius, um, you know, and come up with the perfect product, the perfect time, like, you&#8217;ve still gotta keep those, the, you know, there&#8217;s wear and tear. If you build the perfect car and you&#8217;re rolling down the road, good for you.  </p>\n\n\n\n<p>But there&#8217;s, there&#8217;s wear and tear. There&#8217;s also gonna be other people that go, oh, I can build a car like that and start racing you. I mean, all these things that compound [01:12:00] over time. Mm-hmm. . It took me a long time to understand the time aspect of a lot of what we do both in business and even in like programming and stuff like that of um, you know, and to get technical for a minute.  </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Like there&#8217;s, uh, you know, when you click on something that triggers an event within a website, but technically there&#8217;s a number of events, you know, mouse down versus mouse click versus, you know, da da da da da. And all of these things happen in an order, and most, a lot of it&#8217;s, um, fixed now. But there was a time when different browsers would put mouse down before mouse click, you know, or the other way around.  </p>\n\n\n\n<p>It&#8217;s like just this other level of thinking that I was able to abstract and now look at also in the context of building product and building business and whatnot of you&#8217;ve. You&#8217;ve got the people involved, you&#8217;ve got the ideas, you&#8217;ve got all this stuff. But tomorrow the landscape might be different. If somebody else comes [01:13:00] out with a plugin that does or doesn&#8217;t do, or proves or doesn&#8217;t prove everything we&#8217;re talking about, we, we have to adjust all of our thinking, you know?  </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Mm-hmm. , which was honestly half the fun,&nbsp;  </p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>cory:</strong> but I like your positive spin on that. . I like it. It&#8217;s cause you know, we&#8217;re doing this in public and you&#8217;re like, yeah, somebody go, okay, cool. Thank you for getting me that way. I&#8217;m gonna go do this. You know? Um, and that&#8217;s the, that&#8217;s part of playing this game. Yeah.&nbsp;  </p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Corey:</strong> I mean, and we, as we&#8217;ve talked about, we have the luxury of, we, we are not desperate.  </p>\n\n\n\n<p>We do not need this to succeed tomorrow. Um, and I&#8217;ve, I&#8217;ve definitely, I have been in that seat. I put myself in that seat years ago, um, counted on like, oh, the, my next product has to succeed, or I can&#8217;t pay rent, and I [01:14:00] made no good decisions. Mm-hmm. . And so for me, that&#8217;s, I, I know people who work better under pressure.  </p>\n\n\n\n<p>I do not. And so for me, that&#8217;s, I&#8217;ve, I&#8217;ve worked long and hard to get to a position of luxury entitlement, privilege, uh, knowledge and experience where I can build product or play this game, like you said, under the circumstances that are best for me. Mm-hmm. . And I think that that&#8217;s, that only comes with time and experience.  </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Yeah.&nbsp;  </p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>cory:</strong> It&#8217;s good timing for both of us because I&#8217;ve painfully, you know, trodden this path for a long time. You know, like, I don&#8217;t know if I told you the story back buddy, but we can do that next week. But you know, so much of this, it felt like high stakes poker in a sense of, in the past for me, because we were a product company and trying to dial this stuff in, [01:15:00] felt so much like art and not science.  </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Um, I still think it&#8217;s a blend of those two, art and science where Oh, sure. Like if I hadn&#8217;t had you and we&#8217;re doing this, talking this through, I would&#8217;ve went into a different direction that probably wouldn&#8217;t have been right. But because I had you, cuz like for instance, you grounded me back to let&#8217;s, let&#8217;s concentrate on the, the foundation.  </p>\n\n\n\n<p>I was like, ding, ding, thank you for the grounding. Mm-hmm. . And like, then we real quickly got what that should be. You&#8217;ve surprised me and already been doing some of that work and it&#8217;s like that&#8217;s, that&#8217;s where we need to be right&nbsp;  </p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Corey:</strong> now. And I&#8217;ve been desperate to work with somebody for years. You know, I&#8217;ve pretty much always been the solopreneur, solo founder, solo builder.  </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Yeah. And have often had wonderful people around me willing to ha you know, be in to mastermind with me. Um, you [01:16:00] know, but to have somebody who at least right now is 50 50, um, is, is a whole different experience and, you know, and exceedingly valuable. I definitely, yeah. I feel like we&#8217;ve arrived at a lot of things faster than either one of us would have.  </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Had we had I just been over here banging away at Yeah. The plugin that you asked me for and I was thinking about, but was like, well, you know, is this, is this, I&nbsp;  </p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>cory:</strong> think too, sorry, I didn&#8217;t mean to cut you off. No, go, go, go. I, I think too, I want to give you a real gratitude in this is like, because of your experiences, Uh, a lot of developers I&#8217;ve worked with, um, there&#8217;s high idealism and I really love that.  </p>\n\n\n\n<p>I value that. And then, but you&#8217;ve had enough experiences that go, we can&#8217;t do everything. You know, you know enough about the business and marketing side [01:17:00] that, and how things get done, where I&#8217;m not having to be like, I&#8217;ve had those conversations before and this feels really fluid and I compliment you for that.  </p>\n\n\n\n<p>And thank you for being a partner because, you know, oftentimes the way I&#8217;ve experienced is like negative. That&#8217;s why I gave all this caveats when I was like, Hey, I&#8217;m not talking about technical. I don&#8217;t know what the technical, cuz I feel like it&#8217;s been past conversations. Mm-hmm. and I&#8217;m like, I&#8217;m talking conceptually.  </p>\n\n\n\n<p>But you get that, you know. Yeah. You&#8217;re like, yeah, we we&#8217;re not in these 30 seconds deciding to do a two month long feature, . We&#8217;re exploring it, trying to make a good decision that&#8217;s best for us. The product, the user. So thank you for that. And that, that&#8217;s experience, Corey, I mean, seriously, as,&nbsp;  </p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Corey:</strong> as a dev, it, it is because I was the grumpy programmer in the corner for, there&#8217;s so many, at least a decade, you know,&nbsp;  </p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>cory:</strong> and there&#8217;s so many too.  </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Like I, that experience and I get it [01:18:00] because you all are brilliant and you can do these things like write code, do this stuff. Like, I&#8217;m like, that&#8217;s another thing I haven&#8217;t accessed. And so, yeah. Sorry I cut you off again, but No, it&#8217;s fine. Saying fine, but I just, I&#8217;m thankful for those experiences, . Yeah. I,&nbsp;  </p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Corey:</strong> I don&#8217;t know why so many developers are assholes to be blunt about it.  </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Like there&#8217;s, there&#8217;s a, a feeling of power. Great. Uh, uh, where that comes from. I don&#8217;t know. I mean, and I, I know where mine came from, uh, but it&#8217;s unique to my upbringing and situation and mentality and all that stuff. And, you know, so it, I, I can&#8217;t imagine that everybody had the same, uh, experiences I did that arrived at this.  </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Like, I am genius. You all should bow before me just because I learned to code. Um, but thankfully what, what is interesting to me is, uh, therapy and yeah, uh, getting into [01:19:00] product forced me to learn empathy. I had to, you know, I, I read all the, I showed it last week. I have all the books on graphic design and user interface and don&#8217;t make me think and, uh, all those types of, of books and, um, you know, and so I could design a good product.  </p>\n\n\n\n<p>But then the, the product I alluded to a minute ago, from 15 years ago, I had, um, people who, uh, I had grandmothers and very non-technical people, and I had, um, people in, uh, countries where there&#8217;s not much economic, um, structure and whatnot. And, uh, using my pro, that&#8217;s why they were using my product. So basically, instead of mint.com that relied on plugging in all of your banking info.  </p>\n\n\n\n<p>I had people in Nepal who were like, we don&#8217;t have bank [01:20:00] accounts, but I would still like to track my spending. Um, so it was kind of a neat little, you know, but I was like, oh, well just, you know, saying to the grandma or saying to somebody who, you know, totally different, um, cultural context. Like, oh, just click on this and click on this.  </p>\n\n\n\n<p>And they&#8217;re like, you know, or, or people who only have phones. And so I&#8217;m like, well go to the desktop view. And they&#8217;re like, what? What desktop view or whatever it is, you know? And so I had to learn. Empathy and that I wasn&#8217;t always right. ,&nbsp;  </p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>cory:</strong> I think he just hit it. There&#8217;s this level of genius and creativity that so many developers like you have talked to.  </p>\n\n\n\n<p>And I&#8217;m like, I value it. We in the world value it. And then there&#8217;s this other side, and I think so many of the developers I know had to go through some crucible to get to like, okay, I need this other side. A genius needs help. You know, like you need a supporting cast. Um, but, and I&#8217;ve seen [01:21:00] enough developers go, you gotta go through this event where you get burned.  </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Hmm. Like, you realize like, maybe my shit isn&#8217;t the best. And you get a little humbled. And, and, and I&#8217;m not saying that lightly either. It&#8217;s, it&#8217;s probably a very tough experience. I&#8217;ve probably had dozens of those in other areas of my life. Right. Sure. But then learning like, okay, geniuses don&#8217;t operate in the silo.  </p>\n\n\n\n<p>They need teams. Yeah. They need people and humans. And then you hit it with the empathy. You pair those two together though, you got something like, I would always kind of say like, I&#8217;m, I, we need a translator because I need you to talk human for a second. Mm-hmm. , because I don&#8217;t understand these things. And I, that was always the role I played.  </p>\n\n\n\n<p>I was like, I don&#8217;t understand it, but if I get it, I can help other people get it. Right. A lot of other people get your work, so,&nbsp;  </p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Corey:</strong> and you can sell it. Yeah.&nbsp;  </p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>cory:</strong> Uh, man, thank you for the, for letting us go over. Um, but speaking of therapists, I have mine in six minutes, but, um, and I can [01:22:00] use the bathroom, but dude, I, I&#8217;m, I&#8217;m enjoying this journey with you, my friend.  </p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Corey:</strong> Yeah. Right back at you. We&#8217;re gonna have some good luck to your brother.&nbsp;  </p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>cory:</strong> We&#8217;re gonna have to find some time this year to get together and hang out. Find a hot tub where it&#8217;s warm or you know, not&nbsp;  </p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Corey:</strong> five degrees, two, two quarries, and two Lindsay&#8217;s in a hot tub. There you go. That&#8217;s the, that&#8217;s the other podcast.  </p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>cory:</strong> That&#8217;s&nbsp;  </p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Corey:</strong> the other podcast thinking the same thing. Just mar marital advice or something.  </p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>cory:</strong> Mine would be what not to do. There you go.&nbsp;  </p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Corey:</strong> Thanks my friend. Good, good luck to your brother and uh, hope everything sorts itself out. Okay. Enjoy some jello.</p>\n<p>This article was published at Post Status — the community for WordPress professionals.</p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Wed, 15 Mar 2023 21:13:25 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:11:\"Cory Miller\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:25;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:86:\"WPTavern: WooCommerce 7.5.0 Introduces 3 New Blocks, Expands Support for Global Styles\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:30:\"https://wptavern.com/?p=142738\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:96:\"https://wptavern.com/woocommerce-7-5-0-introduces-3-new-blocks-expands-support-for-global-styles\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:2193:\"<p><a href=\"https://developer.woocommerce.com/2023/03/14/woocommerce-7-5-released/\">WooCommerce 7.5.0</a> was released this week with three new blocks for the Product Archive templates.

My name is Nathan Wrigley.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Jukebox is a podcast which is dedicated to all things WordPress. The people, the events, the plugins, the blocks, the themes, and in this case, what a WordPress certification might look like.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you&#8217;d like to subscribe to the podcast, you can do that by searching for WP Tavern in your podcast, player of choice, or by going to WPTavern.com forward slash feed forward slash podcast. And you can copy that URL into most podcast players.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you have a topic that you&#8217;d like us to feature on the podcast, I&#8217;m keen to hear from you, and hopefully get you all your ideas featured on the show.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Head to WPTavern.com forward slash contact forward slash jukebox, and you use the form there.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So on the podcast today we have Talisha Lewallen.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>You might have found your way into WordPress intentionally, or perhaps you stumbled across it and decided to explore further. Whichever it was, you&#8217;ve learned things along the way. Some of it might have been through training, but there&#8217;s likely been some self discovery on the way as well.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Perhaps you&#8217;re a coder, or a designer. In fact, there are dozens of different pathways in the WordPress ecosystem. Given the broad range of knowledge you might possess, how can you prove that you know what you know?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Many industries provide training programs which, when completed successfully, allow you to assert that you were competent in a given area. You&#8217;d want your lawyer or surgeon to have passed through the appropriate programs of study, so that they&#8217;re equipped to do the work.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>With WordPress being such a dominant force in the world of websites. Would it be a good idea to have a certification for WordPress? Talisha certainly thinks so, and has founded CertifyWP to try to make that happen.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We approach this subject through the work that she&#8217;s been doing at WPConnects, in which she&#8217;s been trying to provide training to military veterans, so that on the departure from the services they have the prospect of finding work in the WordPress space.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We talk about whether there&#8217;s a need for certification for WordPress and how such a certification would come about. What levels of training does Talisha see as essential, and how many such layers might there be?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We discuss whether the WordPress community is ready for a third party to be certifying people&#8217;s abilities, and whether this strays away from the approach that we&#8217;ve had so far in which routes into employment have relied on other, less formal, methods.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Later in the podcast, we talk about the structure of CertifyWP, and who&#8217;s behind the project. You&#8217;ll hear that it&#8217;s not just Talisha. There&#8217;s quite a few members of the WordPress community who want this project to succeed.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you&#8217;re curious about certifications in the WordPress space, this podcast is for you.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you&#8217;re interested in finding out more, you can find all the links in the show notes by heading to WPTavern.com forward slash podcast, where you&#8217;ll find all the other episodes as well.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And so without further delay, I bring you Talisha Lewallen.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I am joined on the podcast today by Talisha Lewallen, Hello Talisha.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:04:00] Talisha Lewallen: Hi Nathan.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:04:02] Nathan Wrigley: Very nice to meet with you. You&#8217;re welcome on the podcast. Thank you for joining us. Would you mind just introducing yourself and give us some indication of what you do, perhaps who you work for, and how come you are in any way connected with WordPress?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:04:18] Talisha Lewallen: Yes. I am Talisha Lewallen. And I am the owner of WPConnects, which is a company that helps US military veterans or really any veterans, but helps them receive training while they&#8217;re active duty, and then when they&#8217;re separating from the military we provide them with mentors and help them find employment within WordPress.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And then I&#8217;ve also started this new venture with some very amazing people within the WordPress community called CertifyWP Foundation. And that is where we are creating a couple of WordPress credentials.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:04:51] Nathan Wrigley: So we&#8217;re going to talk about both of those endeavors today, but I think probably the correct road into both of those subjects is if we begin with WPConnects. Now, you mentioned that this is a company that you are the founder of. It&#8217;s got a mission, it&#8217;s connected with the military, but in broad outline really, it&#8217;s a, it&#8217;s an endeavor to connect people who are looking for work and are in need of guidance. Do you just want to tell us how all this started and what really the bedrock, the core philosophy is, and who you are helping and how you are helping?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:05:26] Talisha Lewallen: Yeah. So I worked at Post Status for a little while, and while we were over there, we kept hearing a lot of people state that they really needed some trained WordPress developers and employees. And so that really got us thinking, you know, it&#8217;s one of those twist of fate things, that we ran into a gentleman named Hector who has a similar company to WPConnects.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And he&#8217;s definitely been a very big mentor to me. So when service members go in and sign up to join the military, a lot of times they&#8217;ve never had an interview, they&#8217;ve never had job experience, they&#8217;re literally just starting their career. Well, when they get out there are transferable skills, but not a lot employers are looking for, if that makes sense. So we want to provide them with, it&#8217;s called transitioning assistance. And we want to provide them with that training and so it helps them transition into the civilian sector a lot easier. There&#8217;s different skills that, you know, we do over here. And then we&#8217;re training them for WordPress front end and backend development.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And if they wanted to do anything else in WordPress. You know, it&#8217;s really expanding past just developer careers. And so we&#8217;re just really helping them find the right connections, along with mentors who have been where they&#8217;ve been and can help them transition and really just know that experience.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And so it really just comes from a place of, I have several members in my family that were in the military, and seeing them transition out of the military was kind of hard. I took the general route over here and I went to high school, college and then started my professional career and seeing my family members and friends join the military, and then when they get out and they had these amazing jobs in the military. They had all of this training and then they get out and they can&#8217;t even get a job.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I heard one of my friends tell me the story of a gentleman who was a military police officer and couldn&#8217;t get a job as a police officer here in the States. And it&#8217;s because he didn&#8217;t have, in that town, you had to have an associate&#8217;s degree. So he didn&#8217;t have the training to become a police officer when that&#8217;s all he did for 10 years in the military, was be a police officer.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And so it&#8217;s very interesting to see the skills that they have and the jobs that these men and women have had, and then transferring it into civilian life. It&#8217;s just not, or hasn&#8217;t been there. They&#8217;ve just been struggling to find these employment. And so we&#8217;re really just reaching out a hand and saying, let us help you and let us get you introduced to these amazing people inside of WordPress. WordPress has the best community that I have ever been a part of, and so it really just seems like a good fit for them.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:08:04] Nathan Wrigley: Can I ask, do you give them a curriculum which they follow? In other words, have you mapped out, in the same way that a university may do, you know, you&#8217;d attend a university and you would fully expect that they would provide you with the course and they&#8217;re not just making it up on the fly? Or is it more working with them to try and figure out what they need? It might be a mixture of both. I don&#8217;t know.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:08:25] Talisha Lewallen: Yeah, so how we do it, we have three pathways right now. And this is what makes WPConnects very unique, even within the military training field. So there&#8217;s a saying in the military that&#8217;s crawl, walk, run. So you&#8217;re not just going to get something and immediately start running. So our steps for crawl, walk, run are these three pathways.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The first one is the credentialing assistance program. Active duty and reserve military personnel are able to take a credential and it is funded through the military, so it does not cost them a dime. And they&#8217;re able to take this training. So we currently have the web foundation associate credential. And this is also where CertifyWP comes in.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So currently we&#8217;re using that WFA course. So once they complete that and they decide to transition out of the military. It could be the next month, whenever their service contract&#8217;s up. It can be two, three years later. Whenever they are transitioning out in the last 180 days of their service contract, they can join what&#8217;s called a Skill Bridge program.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So we also have a WordPress Skill Bridge program. This program is an instructor-led 12 week course. And it&#8217;s all over the US. We do it over Zoom, and we&#8217;re looking at a few other platforms. But again, it&#8217;s that instructor is there. There is a curriculum, and they are learning how to, mostly that one is backend development, is what they&#8217;re learning currently.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And then whenever they finish that, we just opened up an apprenticeship program in Texas. And we&#8217;re about to open one in Oklahoma. And so it&#8217;s just this three step process. The apprenticeship program, they have certain skills that they will acquire throughout the year long apprenticeship program. And then they are 100% ready to be employed and be able to do any job that they&#8217;re really wanting to do, because we will give them that individualized skill.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And through all of that, they have a mentor that they can reach out to, and the mentors reach out to them and just help them with anything they&#8217;re struggling with or have questions about. There&#8217;s different terminology that we use in civilian life than they&#8217;ve used in the military. And so really that person&#8217;s just to be there, to just have a helping hand.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But yeah, it&#8217;s a little bit of both. We have a pathway, we have curriculum. And we do change our curriculum. We get feedback from other people within WordPress. Nikki with Liquid Web has been the biggest help for our Skill Bridge program. She comes through and interviews and mock interviews just about every person we have in our programs and helps give us feedback so we can help them gain those interview skills. We have them write a resume and then I go through and help them work on their resume, so then they have that resume whenever they get out as well.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:10:59] Nathan Wrigley: I guess if you are in a different industry, there may already have been for a great deal of time, there may have been institutions or pathways like this already set up. You mentioned the example there of the police and that pathway not really working out. But presumably there are other ways that people leaving the military can go and there&#8217;s things that are already concrete. Institutions that they can join. Companies that they can join. Programs that they can go through. But not in the WordPress space.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And given WordPress&#8217; 43, and counting, percent share of the internet, it&#8217;s a really credible career to go in, but it&#8217;s a difficult thing to, I would imagine, to even understand. If you&#8217;ve never touched the internet before, apart from being a user and a consumer of the web, you may have no skills or whatsoever.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So I&#8217;m guessing it&#8217;s bridging that gap. Trying to persuade people that actually there&#8217;s a job in here. It&#8217;s an in demand job. Can be well paid and a good career path, and there&#8217;s a nice community behind it all as well.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:11:57] Talisha Lewallen: Right. And you know, we have some people that are literally, I&#8217;ve never touched a computer before. But we also have people that come through the program that have been a part of the satellite operations within the military, or have done tech in the military. But getting that pathway to employment is what they really need. And learning WordPress. There&#8217;s a lot that goes into WordPress that we want our individuals to learn and that will help them grow within whatever job they decide to do. But yeah, so we have two opposite ends of the spectrum usually. We have the ones that have a ton of tech experience, or the ones that have no tech experience.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:12:33] Nathan Wrigley: So that was a really nice introduction into the why really, for the next bit of the podcast, which I think will consume the rest of the show. So we&#8217;re going to talk now, instead of talking about WPConnects, we&#8217;re going to talk about credentialing in the WordPress space. And maybe I&#8217;ll begin this way.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If I were to attend a university that everybody&#8217;s heard of, let&#8217;s say I&#8217;ve been to, I don&#8217;t know, Harvard or Cambridge or somewhere like that. That credential that you hold, it&#8217;s a real passport. Everybody understands what that means, and you present it to employers and they get, okay. Right, you&#8217;ve been to a university, we know what that university is about. We understand that it&#8217;s been around for a while and, that&#8217;s a credible piece of paper that you are holding. But curiously, in the tech space, there are things like this, but specifically in the WordPress space, there&#8217;s nothing like this.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>There&#8217;s a great big hole there, isn&#8217;t there? So people who wish to be employed, going to an employer, you really are relying on testimonials, the CV, the reputation that you&#8217;ve got from your previous employer, and the letters that they may write on your behalf. But there&#8217;s no bit of paper that you can hold, going in cold, to say, I&#8217;ve done this. Look, there it is. It&#8217;s certifiable. This is what I&#8217;ve achieved.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:13:51] Talisha Lewallen: Yes. And you know, that&#8217;s what we&#8217;re kind of finding out on both ways. Having a credential helps both employers and people looking for employment, especially within the WordPress space, without having that credential. There&#8217;s a lot of people that I would say could very well do certain jobs. But because there&#8217;s not that level of credentialing and there&#8217;s not that standard education.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>What does a WordPress developer mean? What can you do if you say you&#8217;re a WordPress developer? And that&#8217;s what a lot of companies are running into. So it really is almost word of mouth. Sometimes I feel like I should say that it&#8217;s almost word of mouth for you to get hired, because somebody&#8217;s worked with you and knows your level of skill. If you&#8217;re new to the WordPress space, it could possibly be harder to find a job because nobody knows who you are, your work ethic and what your skillset is.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:14:39] Nathan Wrigley: Yeah. So that&#8217;s the premise behind all of this. So I guess I should ask at the beginning, what level are you going in at? Because really in the WordPress space, we could probably come up with 50 curricular that people could follow, probably more. We could have things on the hosting side, speed optimization, SEO, backend WordPress. The sky&#8217;s the limit, but I&#8217;m presuming. That in the scenario that you are dealing with, mainly it&#8217;s getting started?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:15:08] Talisha Lewallen: You know, that&#8217;s the interesting thing. So we, so we have the advisory board. I should say, whenever I first decided this is something I want to do, I really want to make this credential. I reached out to several people, because I kept hearing nos and yeses, and so we put together a team of an advisory board and we had this conversation.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Because originally I was thinking about one credential, that would have three tiers. So now we&#8217;ve decided on two. We&#8217;re going to have a front end developer credential and the backend developer credential. So each one will have three tiers. So it starts at base level of here&#8217;s how I download a WordPress. This is how I can add admins. This is how I do, you know, very, very basic.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Then there&#8217;s the next level, and then there&#8217;s the expert level. So to obtain the credential, you must pass, it&#8217;s either one cumulative exam, or you could take it with each course. So you take that exam that has all three tiers of those, and that&#8217;s how you obtain that credential.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And that&#8217;ll be on the backend credential too. It&#8217;ll have that three tiers again, crawl, walk, run. We&#8217;re not going to expect you to be able to do it if you&#8217;ve never been taught the why behind it. So with that being said, one conversation that I had with a gentleman was, well, you know, it almost turned into some people can take tests, but some people can&#8217;t. That doesn&#8217;t mean that they&#8217;re able to do the job. And I said exactly, and that&#8217;s where we are trying to find a way. It&#8217;s still, still alluding me a little bit, but we are trying to find a way to have a practical part to the exam, in the top two tiers.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The first tier exam probably will just be question and answer type exam. But in that expert level, I want there to be a practical part of it. To have people show that, yes, I did learn how to master this skill. And yes, I can do this. And so I think that that&#8217;ll help. Also with the credential and why it&#8217;s, I think, beneficial to WordPress is, you know, WordPress changes sometimes.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We have big changes, we have small changes. So there&#8217;s a certification that you can take. And that can just be a course. Anybody can come up with a course. I could just go to my back room and be like, this is what I think somebody should know for WordPress and create this certification.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And then I never have to re-certify. I never have to go back in and show that my knowledge has not waned, or that I do still know what I&#8217;m doing, and still have that level, just standard level of education. With a credential, there is an advisory board and a board of directors and you have to re-certify every three years, to show that you are still maintaining that knowledge. So it&#8217;s not 10 years down the road, oh look, I took this and I&#8217;m still here. You&#8217;re able to show that you still maintain that level of credentialing.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:17:53] Nathan Wrigley: That&#8217;s an industry practice that I&#8217;ve seen before, especially in things like networking. And I mean networking in the sense of cables and connecting routers. The organizations often behind that will require you to come back after a given period of time and re-certify yourself. Just because otherwise that credential kind of loses all meaning, because the technology itself has moved on so far in the three, four however many years. That if you claim to know from 10 years ago what&#8217;s required to be known today, there could be a complete mismatch. Okay, that&#8217;s really interesting to know.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:18:25] Talisha Lewallen: There&#8217;s been a lot of thought that went into this credentialing. Along with having, you know, just what I would consider WordPress experts that are being there and really talking about what they feel somebody should know in the WordPress for each level of the credentialing.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But, let&#8217;s see. I think JavaScript has a credential that you have to re-certify. If you&#8217;re a nurse, here in the US you have to re-certify your knowledge. Car mechanics. You know, so there&#8217;s a lot of credentialing out there in every industry that does have that continuing education piece. Just because things do change, the world changes so much, and it&#8217;s very beneficial.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:18:58] Nathan Wrigley: So given that you are hoping to find people who wish to take these credentials. Is it open to anybody? We know that your background was connecting with people leaving the military. Is the intention of CertifyWP, and of course I should have mentioned the URL. The URL that you&#8217;ll go to, which of course I&#8217;ll put in the the show notes is certifywp.com, as you&#8217;d imagine, it&#8217;s all spelled in the typical way. No, no underscores or anything like that. Is the intention that these certifications will be open to everybody? Or is there a subset of people? What&#8217;s the audience for this?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:19:37] Talisha Lewallen: So the audience for the credential is everybody. CertifywP is for anybody and everybody to take. Our hope would be that companies start looking at their credential and stating that, yes, I want to hire people that have this credential because we know they have this baseline education. So it is open to every single person.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The baseline, the level one certifications I hope to get into some smaller communities. I live here in Oklahoma and so there&#8217;s a lot of Indian capital technology centers and stuff like that, that I would really like them to start taking these credentials and really trying to help the minority groups get more into WordPress as well.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But one thing that has confused a lot of people, and I have to say that this is definitely my fault. I expect everybody to be on my brainwave sometimes. The mention of the DoD, the Department of Defense has thrown a lot of people off. And so they think that this is just a credential for the military and that is really the farthest from it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And I just have not fully been able to explain that to everybody. But the DoD approving the credential comes in for WPConnects, so that we can train our military. Instead of using that web foundation associate credential, we will use our WordPress credentialing to train them. So they will be trained from the bottom up in WordPress. So that&#8217;s where that has came in. But CertifyWP is open to everybody to take.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:21:03] Nathan Wrigley: Okay, so just to clarify that. There was a hoop that you had to jump through in order to receive money from the government to train people from the military, but the training is ostensibly the same, but there&#8217;s that slightly strange mixed messaging there. Have I parsed that right?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:21:20] Talisha Lewallen: Yes, yeah. And that&#8217;s all it is, is for our military members to be able to take the training where the government pays for it. They have educational grants and stipends in the Army and Air Force, especially here in the US that they don&#8217;t have to take those, they don&#8217;t have to pay for those credentialing. So for us, for them to be able to use those monies, our credential has to be approved through the DoD.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:21:43] Nathan Wrigley: Speaking of money, that&#8217;s an interesting segue for a minute. Is the intention for this then to have a fee bound to it? In other words, if you want to take this credential and receive the training materials and the time of the tutors and all of that, that there&#8217;ll be a fee attached to it? And, if that&#8217;s the case, do you have plans to have scholarships and things like that? Is there any of that afoot even as an idea?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:22:07] Talisha Lewallen: Yes. That&#8217;s, you know, partly why we actually turned CertifyWP into a nonprofit, is so that we can offer those scholarships. For the credential to be, I almost want to be, say accepted into definitely DoD standards. But if we ever get it accredited, either, there has to be certain qualifications that credentialing meets.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So we&#8217;re trying to set up CertifyWP credentials to meet the qualifications for, one, the DoD, but also if we ever do decide to get it accredited. And one of them is that it has to meet the standard for financial costs. So, I think there&#8217;s even a PHP credential, but the other tech credentials out there, ours will have to match that price.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But we are going to be able to scholarship people in. That is definitely our hope. Because again, we don&#8217;t want this to be a gatekeeping thing of you have to pay to play. Not everybody can do that. And so we definitely want to work with people and companies on just trying to get this credential out to the community and making it affordable for every person.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And there are ways to do that. The board hasn&#8217;t fully decided on one and cost has not even been mentioned yet, just other than the fact that we have to have one and it has to meet an industry standard. But yes, definitely trying to find a way to cut costs down for just the regular person is something that we are looking at, because it can be, they can be quite expensive. And I know that that&#8217;s been a talk within, that I&#8217;ve seen in the Post Status Slack channels before. Whenever somebody moved CertifyWP into one of the channels, somebody was like, oh, here we go, gatekeeping. And oh, it&#8217;s going to cost so much and stuff like that.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And it&#8217;s a very good concern and conversation to have. But our whole intention, and I don&#8217;t want to speak for everybody on the board or advisory board, but isn&#8217;t to keep it away from people. We want everybody to be able to take it. So we are finding ways to really scholarship and bring people in.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:24:01] Nathan Wrigley: So we&#8217;ve talked about the audience, well, one of the audiences or one of the, one of the spokes of the wheel, if you like, for you. But of course there&#8217;s another side to this, and I&#8217;m, imagining that you really are a bridge between the people who want to be certified and the people who subsequently want to receive the wisdom that you&#8217;ve given them, the certification.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In other words, the employers, the people who are going to be employing the people out the other end. And presumably that&#8217;s going to be a challenge that you&#8217;re going to face as well, is convincing businesses that look the certificate that we&#8217;ve given them the certification that they&#8217;ve gone through and achieved actually means something. And I&#8217;m guessing there&#8217;s going to be quite a lot of your time spent making those people aware that it really is bonafide.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:24:46] Talisha Lewallen: Yes. That&#8217;s where having the DoD backing, and also possibly getting it accredited shows that this is a real credential. There are people out there that do see that this credential is a massive benefit. So with that, for us there&#8217;s different ways to get it DoD approved, I should say.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And the easiest way is to have community buy-in. So having those companies state that yes, I do see a need for this education level and to have credentialing. So that&#8217;s where on the website we have the endorsement letters. And I know Sophia Desrosiers has been making some phone calls and we have a couple of people that have been reaching out to companies and explaining what we&#8217;re really doing.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Because we&#8217;re trying to get those endorsement letters because that will help us get it DoD approved. It&#8217;s just showing that there is a need in the community for a credential. Not even our credential. It&#8217;s one of those fun little things, but it&#8217;s just saying that there is a need in the community.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And I definitely think once we get our credentials up and running and people start seeing what we have in there, and the education. I really think that a lot of companies will come around to it. The ones that I&#8217;ve talked to so far, I talked to one that was a little hesitant and I love that he booked a meeting with me and talked to me about his concerns, and that I was able to, I don&#8217;t want to say that I argued my point, just was able to genuinely share what we are trying to do at CertifyWP, which is just to make a community built and maintain credential.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And he ended up signing our endorsement letter, and I absolutely loved it. But I loved that space to be able to fully explain what we&#8217;re doing and how we&#8217;re setting up the credential to really benefit not only employers, but the job seeker.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:26:29] Nathan Wrigley: It&#8217;s a virtuous cycle in a way, isn&#8217;t it? In that if you get people on board and you can take them through the whole process and then they are ultimately employed, and the employers are happy that they can hit the ground running at whatever level that may be. That has a sort of feedback loop to it, doesn&#8217;t it?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>After a period of time, the employers will broadcast that message. It will presumably encourage people who are looking for a way to be certified in tech, to hop on board and on it goes. So yeah, that&#8217;s going to quite an important part. So you are reaching out to those people and you&#8217;re hoping to get some more on board to bolster the whole enterprise.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:27:07] Talisha Lewallen: Yeah, we definitely need more endorsement letters from the community. It could be individuals or companies. The companies are what really the DoD is looking for. But just showing the need in the community. And like I said, I&#8217;ve talked to quite a few either hiring managers or companies that have sat here and said, you know, I put out a job description and I need a WordPress developer. And then I pay them the salary and they come in and they can&#8217;t do what we need them to do.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But on their resume it looked fine. And they were able to say these things, but they didn&#8217;t have the education that they needed. So then it costs the company more money to have to train this person to be able to get them up to this level, to where if we are able to train them and then you&#8217;re able to hire them, and you know they passed this, I hate to say they passed the test, but they&#8217;re able to show that their competency is there. It saves companies time and money on hiring.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:28:00] Nathan Wrigley: Speaking of the test, you mentioned that in some scenarios it may be like a written paper or something like that, but presumably the higher up you go on the ladder of difficulty, the more need there will be for practical implementations. And you said that there was still room to be, you&#8217;re still trying to figure all that out, and work out what that path might be, but I guess that&#8217;d be an interesting subject to pause on for a moment.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>What are your thoughts around that? Testing in some kind of platform that allows you to do code examples on the screen, live. Those kind of things. Just essentially making sure that it&#8217;s legit, it&#8217;s bonafide, and that the people that are doing it are actually doing it. You could be bringing them into test centres. There&#8217;s all sorts of permutations here, isn&#8217;t there?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:28:41] Talisha Lewallen: Exactly. And that&#8217;s where, right now, I&#8217;m looking at LMSs, Learning Management Systems to put the coursework, but also the exam on. And so I&#8217;ve been talking a lot with these companies about what this exam could look like with this practical application. And what I hear a lot, and even this has been suggested in conversations with the advisory board is almost having like a capstone, or a project that they complete after they take the written assessment. In having this practical that they turn in.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And that is always an option, and we might have to go to that. I&#8217;m leery about that because then we will have to train and hire people to look at these capstone projects if you will. And determine if somebody has passed or failed it. And so then you run into, well maybe I got somebody that graded my capstone or my project harder than person B.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I really shy away from that type of stuff and I&#8217;d rather have it be computer generated. It&#8217;s unbiased. There&#8217;s just so many ways you can set that up to where there&#8217;s not that fault in there. So definitely the back end and coding one, there will be sides once you get higher up for you to actually code. I&#8217;m not a coder, so I don&#8217;t want to sit here and use terminology that I don&#8217;t understand myself.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But there is that practical part in there where you&#8217;re actually going to go in there and you&#8217;re going to do it. The front end side&#8217;s going to look, you know, a little bit differently, but still, I&#8217;m not a test taker, but I can perform the task and I can do the job generally.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But then you have other people, and I always use the example of my sister. I love her to death. She&#8217;s very, very smart. And she could take a test like nobody&#8217;s business, but that doesn&#8217;t always mean that she can do the work that she just tested on. It just means that she can have really good memory recollection. But doing the task is not something that is there all the time.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And so we really want to hit both sides. As well as companies having the confidence that when they hire somebody with this credential, they know that they passed the practical part and they can do it. And so it&#8217;s really just trying to find out the best, we&#8217;ll say best, most efficient, cost effective way to really have this and what is best for everybody.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Because what I really don&#8217;t want to get into is somebody sitting there and saying, well, I didn&#8217;t pass the exam because of, you know, X, Y, Z. And it ended up, it could have been human error. Computers have errors too, and we can work with that. But I just want to take the human error side out of it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:31:07] Nathan Wrigley: I can imagine there&#8217;s going to be a subset of people listening to this podcast who will be thinking there should be no canonical certification in WordPress. We should be open to go wherever we choose. It feels like you would like this to have some sort of backing, if you like. Community backing, if nothing else. Not necessarily official backing. But you&#8217;d like this to become a baseline. Something that anybody can aspire to, and anybody can see within the community that this is something which represents a decent beginning if you like.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Not really sure I&#8217;ve phrased that question particularly well, but what I&#8217;m trying to say is that there&#8217;s going to be some people who say, why do we need this? What&#8217;s the point when we&#8217;ve been getting along just fine for many, many years? We don&#8217;t want one player dominating the market in accreditation and certifications. So we&#8217;ll just speak to that for a minute.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:32:00] Talisha Lewallen: Yeah. I&#8217;ve had this conversation, it actually might have been on Bob&#8217;s podcast. And through a conversation that I had with somebody else, it got brought up to why CertifyWP. Why should a third party be able to have this credentialing instead of either the hosting companies or Automattic themselves, whichever way you want to look at it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Why should this third party be able to do it? And my answer is always, why not? We are able to have this just absolutely community built and maintained. I think it gives us the freedom is what I should say. It gives us the freedom to be able to keep it unbiased as possible, to where it benefits the most people that we can.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Not everybody&#8217;s going to be happy with it, no matter what we do, and that&#8217;s fine. We&#8217;re here to help the most people that we can. So having it community built and maintained just allows for a little bit more freedom to get the information that we see as a community that people need to learn, and have to be able to do the jobs that we are hiring them for, or that we want them to do.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And so my example, if you go onto Fiverr, and again, I&#8217;m not dissing anybody that works on Fiverr or does websites. It is a great platform for you to be able to get contract work. But when you look on there and you look at a WordPress developer, I need a WordPress website. There are, I mean, it seems like thousands of people out there that are like, oh, I&#8217;m a WordPress expert.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And I even saw a couple that were I&#8217;m certified in WordPress. And I&#8217;m like, no you&#8217;re not, because there&#8217;s not one. It&#8217;s one of those that people that are just an average Joe that&#8217;s trying to get their website built is not going to know about the community. That we don&#8217;t already have this certification. That we don&#8217;t already have all of this baseline knowledge. They&#8217;re not going to know.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And so this credential allows even contractors to hire the right person and know that they have been certified, and that they know what they&#8217;re doing and they know what they&#8217;re going to get out of the product based off of that. So it really, it&#8217;s really just this, I keep going back to community built and maintained, because I want, I really want everybody to know it&#8217;s not us sitting here saying that, oh, we have the master knowledge and we, we know what everybody needs, because we don&#8217;t.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And that&#8217;s where we are willing to hear your side and your opinion and really build the credential that the community needs and is going to use and finds the most benefit out of. We&#8217;re coming from a very big place of love and light and you know, trying just to help. And you know, that&#8217;s just really where we&#8217;re at at this point.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:34:28] Nathan Wrigley: With that conversation in mind, have you had any collisions with the use of WordPress, because obviously WordPress, the word is a trademark. I noticed that you&#8217;re calling it CertifyWP, so you&#8217;ve, you&#8217;ve sidestep that one, but I wonder if there are any collisions there that need to be avoided.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:34:49] Talisha Lewallen: So, so far, I&#8217;ll say now, we have been in contact with Josepha and Matt Mullenweg has been on some email chains. I have not personally got to speak to Matt about these, but Michelle Frechette, fantastic woman, and saves my life every day, I swear. Michelle, and myself had a meeting with Josepha and we sat down and we explained what we are trying to, and it really, I mean it was a very positive conversation in my opinion.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And so it was never brought up that, I&#8217;d hate to say that, you know, we get trademark or you know, cease and desist, but it was really, they were just trying to figure out where they wanted their position to be and that they would get back to us.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And that was around December and, you know, you got to love the holidays and everything else. But so far, no. But we are definitely wanting to also work with everybody with inside WordPress. So we would never want to do anything that Matt or Josepha would think that was not appropriate to the point of wanting us to cease and desist or whatever else.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And I also know that there&#8217;s another company, I don&#8217;t know if it&#8217;s public knowledge, so I don&#8217;t want to just like throw it out there. But there is another company that is building or hoping to build a top tier credential. So it would be like our credentialing, and then you would be able to take theirs.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And that would allow participants who had that credential to be hired by these absolutely massive corporations that are in WordPress. There are very large companies that use WordPress and they need a certain type of developer and security knowledge. And so that level of credentialing would take it one step above ours.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And since that company works with those high level companies, they would be the best fit to be able to create that level of credentialing. I mean, that&#8217;s the fun thing. The credentialing is coming. It&#8217;s been talked about a lot and I&#8217;m excited for the growth. I&#8217;m excited for the next couple of years to see where these credentials really take us as a community. But yeah, no, so far the conversations we&#8217;ve had with, I&#8217;ll say the powers that be, have been very positive.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:36:50] Nathan Wrigley: Okay. It&#8217;s just nice to hear that you&#8217;ve had those conversations because obviously that would be an area of, uh, of concern if you hadn&#8217;t, so at least that, that&#8217;s been put on the table, shall we say. You mentioned community a few times there, and it might be an interesting moment just to wrap this up to talk about the people that are involved and what have you.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So, Talisha, there&#8217;s obviously you. But you&#8217;ve got a whole bunch of other people on board. Do you just want to give us a bit of a name drop on who&#8217;s involved so far. And I guess an ancillary question to that is, are you still open for other people to join and lead certain areas, and be involved? Is this still a group which is welcoming community members in to help?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:37:30] Talisha Lewallen: Yes. So right now our advisory board and I always say this like, oh, sorry if I forget anybody. I always feel so bad. Because we have added people on in the last little bit. So we have Courtney Robertson, we have Gabriel Cohen of PMC. Jess Frick from Pressable. Michelle Frechette, love her. And we also have Nikki Bulmer. So they&#8217;re both from the Liquid Web brand. And then we have Robbie Adair with OS Training, and we just brought on Zach Stepek, and we brought him on because once we started talking about, okay, we needed the front end and the back end credential. All of us are talking about the front end, and I said, okay, so what do we know about backend?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>What do we know about really coding and what do we know about all of this? And we all just kind of sat there and we&#8217;re like, okay, we need to find somebody else that could be that expert in that field. So whenever we find there is a lack of our knowledge, or that we could find somebody that has a little bit more, we are definitely open to bringing them on.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It&#8217;s not that we&#8217;re trying to keep it small, but we want to keep the team progressing. And so when you get too many people, sometimes that can be a hindrance to the progression forward, but we also need to have as many people as we need to get the best product possible as well. So we are still open to certain people. If anybody wants to be involved, definitely reach out. If we have the space and need that area of knowledge, definitely want to do that. And then we have our board of directors. And we are trying to keep the board as separate from the advisory board as possible. There are a few people that are crossing over, just because of their expertise and skills whenever we are putting the board together.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So we have myself, Michelle, Nikki and Jess. But then we also have Rob Howard, and Hans. That is currently our board of directors. We have our first meeting today, actually. I&#8217;m very excited about that. And then we have our next advisory board meeting on Thursday, and we are hoping to get the level, so for the front end credential, the level one course and exam approved by the board and the level two course and exam as well. Very exciting stuff happening this week.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:39:50] Nathan Wrigley: Yeah, it&#8217;s all moving forward, isn&#8217;t it? This is really great. We&#8217;re probably just going to have to round it up in terms of time, but before we do that, if people have been listening to this and they&#8217;d like to find out more, possibly get involved from either direction, whether that&#8217;s from the company side, looking to consume the accreditation, or if somebody would like to be involved in taking the accreditation and wants a little bit more information, where are the best places to go to contact either CertifyWP or just you?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:40:18] Talisha Lewallen: Me, you could find me on Post Status Slack. Or you can always hit the contact forms on either website page. They get emailed to myself to either wpconnects.com or certifywp.com. And we are also in Twitter and we now have Tumblr. We just recently got on Tumblr as well. So any of those ways are perfect ways to get ahold of us. Or my email is always a great way, which is just talisha @ wpconnects.com</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:40:46] Nathan Wrigley: As always, I&#8217;ll put the links that you mentioned into the show notes, so if anybody wants to follow those up, just head over to the WP Tavern website, search for this episode and you should be able to find the links there. So it only remains for me to thank you Talisha for coming on the podcast today. I really appreciate it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:41:02] Talisha Lewallen: Well, I very much appreciate you having me and WPConnects and CertifyWP all in one. I know it&#8217;s a lot of information, but I very much appreciate it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:41:11] Nathan Wrigley: Thank you very much indeed.</p>\n</div>\n\n\n\n<p>On the podcast today we have <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/talisha-lewallen-57758b85/\">Talisha Lewallen</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>You might have found your way into WordPress intentionally, or perhaps you stumbled across it and decided to explore further. Whichever it was, you&#8217;ve learned things along the way. Some of it might have been through training, but there’s likely been some self-discovery on the way as well. Perhaps you’re a coder, or a designer. In fact, there are dozens of different pathways in the WordPress ecosystem.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Given the broad range of knowledge you might possess, how can you prove that you know what you know?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Many industries provide training programs which, when completed successfully, allow you to assert that you are competent in a given area. You’d want your lawyer and surgeon to have passed through the appropriate program of study, so that they’re equipped to do that work.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>With WordPress being such a dominant force in the world of websites, would it be a good idea to have a certification for WordPress? Talisha certainly thinks so and has founded <a href=\"https://certifywp.com/\">CertifyWP</a> to try to make that happen.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We approach this subject through the work that she’s been doing at <a href=\"https://wpconnects.com/\">WPConnects</a> in which she’s been trying to provide training to military veterans, so that on their departure from the services, they have the prospect of finding work in the WordPress space.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We talk about whether there is a need for a certification for WordPress and how such a certification would come about. What levels of training does Talisha see as essential, and how many such layers might there be?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We discuss whether the WordPress community is ready for a third party to be certifying people’s abilities and whether this strays away from the approach that we’ve had so far, in which routes into employment have relied upon other, less formal, methods.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Later in the podcast we talk about the structure of CertifyWP and who is behind the project. You’ll hear that it’s not just Talisha, there are quite a few members of the community who want this project to succeed.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you’re curious about certifications in the WordPress space, this podcast is for you.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Useful links.</h2>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://wpconnects.com/\">WPConnects website</a></p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://certifywp.com/\">CertifyWP website</a></p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://dothewoo.io/wordpress-certification/\">Talisha on the Do the Woo podcast</a></p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://twitter.com/wp_connects\">WPConnects Twitter</a></p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.tumblr.com/wp-connects\">WP Connects Tumblr</a></p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Wed, 15 Mar 2023 14:00:00 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:14:\"Nathan Wrigley\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:27;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:54:\"HeroPress: Everybody is a Node: Connecting and Growing\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:56:\"https://heropress.com/?post_type=heropress-essays&p=5400\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:158:\"https://heropress.com/essays/everybody-is-a-node-connecting-and-growing/#utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=everybody-is-a-node-connecting-and-growing\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:21526:\"<img width=\"1024\" height=\"512\" src=\"https://heropress.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/031423-min.jpg\" class=\"attachment-large size-large wp-post-image\" alt=\"Pull Quote: Everybody you encounter is an opportunity to learn and grow, and when we commit to growing together, we create ecosystems of mutual joy.\" /><h2 id=\"h-starting-with-a-definition\">Starting with a Definition</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Google defines the term <em>node </em>as “a point at which lines or pathways intersect.”It’s a connecting point. For the use of <em>node</em> in botany, Google offers a second definition: “the part of a plant stem from which one or more leaves emerge.” It’s a point for growth. Today, I’ll provide a third definition that combines the first two. A <em>node </em>is you, me, and everybody, all on our professional and personal journeys through life.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I currently work as an independent product designer, which perfectly combines my interests in culture, business, and the internet. One day, I hope to evolve my practice into a consulting business for Black-owned internet companies. </p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\">\n<p>My path to my current position and future goal has been shaped by points of intersection with everyone I’ve encountered along the way. </p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>These experiences helped me grow, helped my leaves flourish and my branches stretch further. My pathway collided with others in my field and adjacent areas, and from these interactions, I made connections with mentors, colleagues, and friends.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The business term for this is <em>networking.</em> Something we’re all told to do to move forward in our careers. But making connections is more than just a box to tick on the to-do list of life — it’s the fundamental act that makes our lives worth living.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>For me, the journey to a fulfilling life began in an art museum.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"h-finding-new-direction\">Finding New Direction</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>In college, I pursued a degree in Art History. I interned at, and was later employed by, the Philadelphia Museum of Art. I practically lived in that building during my employment, and I loved it. Art is a way to connect with people: when we interpret creative works, we interpret the human experience. Art helps us understand one another and understand ourselves. I thoroughly enjoy immersing myself in the art world consisting of brick-and-mortar museums and galleries. But as it turned out, art became a stepping stone towards my next passion &#8211; the internet.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>My brain thrives on projects. I love to create and collaborate, and I’m an idea-engine, always itching to bring my concepts to life. Throughout college, I had aspirations to start a website about art, but struggled to find the best avenue to start. </p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\">\n<p>After graduation when my schedule cleared up, a friend working in software engineering turned me toward WordPress. </p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>It was for non-developers like me and provided the digital access I craved for my latest project. His advice permanently shifted my trajectory. Without this interaction, I never would’ve found the pathway to realizing my passions with WordPress.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Using WordPress, I developed the arts website I had dreamt of. That site, <em>In-Art</em> was a place to talk about art online &#8211; <em>include, interpret, interact</em>. At that point, WordPress still felt like a hobby — albeit, the hobby that made me feel the most human. I devoted as much time to it as I could, and began seeking out WordPress meetups.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Little did I know at that very first WordPress Meetup, I’d meet the man who would later become my boss. Dan Olson gave a talk on “The Future of WordPress” at my first Philly WordPress meetup. In hindsight, the title feels like a pun from the universe since WordPress became <em>my </em>future. At this event, I also met Jason McClintock, my mentor and the lead designer at DigitalCube. In fact, he’s the one who suggested Dan hire me!&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"h-verticals\">Verticals</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The beauty of networking is two-fold: verticals and horizontals. In the case of Dan and Jason, Jason serves as my vertical. Verticals have the same specialty, like product design, but are at different stages in their journeys, from interns to experts.&nbsp; Your verticals serve as inspirations and guides when you break into the field, since they’ve been there, done that, and lived to tell you how you can do it too.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Once you’re further along in your professional journey, you take over and become the mentor for other newbies. You bestow upon them all your wisdom, like, “This is the best platform to simplify your process” and “splurge for the large coffee on big project days, your sleepy brain will thank you.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But your verticals are also your competition. Competition doesn’t have to be cutthroat, and should never sway you from interacting with them. </p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\">\n<p>The lessons your verticals will teach you are invaluable, and the act of teaching mentees is fulfilling and enlightening. </p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>However, logically, if you only interact with people who do what you do, you won’t be meeting the people who <em>need</em> what you do. Fellow UX designers don’t have a need for UX design, they have a need for UX design <em>jobs</em>. Who offers jobs like that? That’s where Horizontals come into play.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"h-horizontals\">Horizontals&nbsp;</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Horizontals are the people working side by side in the supply chain of a service. Take a website for example — designers collaborate with developers, marketing specialists, content creators, and business owners to create the strongest final product for their future customers. </p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\">\n<p>Unless you’re a multi-talented wizard with no need for sleep and no limit for creativity, it takes <em>every single team member</em> working together to bring excellent large-scale projects into fruition. </p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>For DigitalCube, Dan was one of my horizontals. Dan’s technical expertise combined well with my passion for networking and public speaking. Together, we created a discovery process for new clients, reworked our events marketing strategy, and improved technical support service.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I’m a people person, and part of what I admire so much about people is how uniquely skilled we are in different ways. Life would be incredibly dull if we all had the same goals, same passions, same drives that make life worth living. Everybody you encounter is an opportunity to learn and grow, and when we commit to growing together, we create ecosystems of mutual joy. There’s an antiquated idea that to be successful, you must work solo. You should be a lone wolf, step on whatever toes necessary to get your foot through the best doors. I wholeheartedly reject that.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Everyone deserves a piece of the pie, and everyone deserves a spot at the table. The horizontals I surround myself with are believers in the power of side-by-side success, in working together to achieve excellence<em> together</em>. This commitment to communal efforts helped me take the leap to finding success and happiness.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"h-how-i-leaped-where-i-landed\">How I Leaped &amp; Where I Landed&nbsp;</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>I dabbled as a digital marking assistant for a few months, but it was a UX bootcamp that really ignited my professional passions. The bootcamp built upon my foundation of WordPress. Before it was even over, I began freelancing by creating elementor websites for others. I started helping entrepreneurs put forth websites that launched their projects and captured their essences through effective, engaging design.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I spend each day actively seeking new clients, growing my portfolio and my abilities with each new project. The clients I work with inspire me and align with my values, an added freedom that comes with entrepreneurship. I’m also preparing business school applications for some point in the future to learn more about finance and management, with the goals of growing a consulting service that will support Black-owned businesses on the web.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Contracting is very fulfilling, and it keeps me connected to the spaces that sparked my passion in the first place. </p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\">\n<p>I continue to attend WordPress meetups and WordCamps, volunteering in any way I can, eager to support the community that motivates me. </p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>I relish these meetups: sources of learning and growing where I could nerd out about all the WordPress topics I love with a bunch of fellow nerds. Plus, the free swag at WordCamps<em> never </em>hurts. In 2020, I crafted my first WordPress talk, leaning on my love of public speaking. These efforts forged even more connections between myself and the WordPress community. Now, I&#8217;m happy to lead the Philly WordPress Meetup Group, recruiting interesting speakers for our events to help forge more connections for our members.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Shoutouts to some WordPress <em>SUPER-</em>nodes who changed the trajectory of my journey:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/emilio-garza-13126490/\">Emilio Garza</a> for telling me to use WordPress for my first website</li>\n\n\n\n<li><a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/dan-t-olson/\">Dan Olson</a>, <a href=\"https://profiles.wordpress.org/hithisisjason/\">Jason McClintock</a>, and <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/hiromichi-koga-128b2428/?originalSubdomain=jp\">Koga Hiromichi</a> for giving me my first big WordPress gig</li>\n\n\n\n<li><a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/amy-letson-phl/\">Amy Letson</a> and <a href=\"https://profiles.wordpress.org/kcristiano/\">Kevin Cristiano</a> for welcoming me as an organizer for the Philadelphia WordPress Meetup group</li>\n\n\n\n<li><a href=\"https://profiles.wordpress.org/mauteri/\">Mike Auteri</a> and <a href=\"https://profiles.wordpress.org/newyorkerlaura/\">Laura Bryne</a> for welcoming into the Montclair WordPress Community</li>\n\n\n\n<li><a href=\"https://profiles.wordpress.org/isvictorious/\">Victor Ramirez</a> for co-hosting WP @ REC Philly with me</li>\n\n\n\n<li><a href=\"https://allienimmons.com/\">Allie Nimmons</a> and <a href=\"https://meetmichelle.online/\">Michelle Frechette</a> for general awesomeness&nbsp;</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"h-moral-of-my-story\">Moral of My Story</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Life is a string of transitions, a catapult of change. Whether you’re a recent graduate with no clear path to finding your peace and realizing your passions, or you’re settled into your career with no clear signs of stalling, life will keep throwing new obstacles and opportunities at you. If you tackle them alone, you’ll enjoy the highs alone, with no one to celebrate your successes. You’ll endure the lows alone too, with no one to offer a helping hand and pull you from your pit of self doubt. You will miss out on critical lessons that set you back in both your professional and personal journeys.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Each day, I immerse myself in growth-centered communities so we can learn and succeed together. I am who I am because of who I’ve met, from college friends, to coworkers, to clients. Here’s the story so far: I’ve found my place, my peace, and my passions. This is a tale I couldn’t tell without the communities, mentors, and friends I’ve encountered along the way.</p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"kb-row-layout-wrap kb-row-layout-id_2abfd1-ed alignnone

This has been changed so that duotone presets are stored as slugs, making the color swatches available when a user changes themes. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Another change for Duotone filters in this release is the ability to set them globally inside the Site Editor&#8217;s Styles panel. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Site Editor also received several improvements to make the design more clear and consistent, updating the designs for the edit button and the add template modal, and cleaning up the template details popover, among other small changes.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Check out the <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/2023/03/13/whats-new-in-gutenberg-15-3-13-march/\">15.3 changelog</a> for the full rundown of all the enhancements, bug fixes, and accessibility and performance improvements.</p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Tue, 14 Mar 2023 21:10:04 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"Sarah Gooding\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:29;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:68:\"WPTavern: WordPress 6.2 RC 2 Drops Navigation Panel from Site Editor\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:30:\"https://wptavern.com/?p=142699\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:79:\"https://wptavern.com/wordpress-6-2-rc-2-drops-navigation-panel-from-site-editor\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:2828:\"<p><a href=\"https://wordpress.org/news/2023/03/wordpress-6-2-release-candidate-2/\">WordPress 6.2 RC 2</a> was released today on schedule. The new Navigation section in the Site Editor was <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/2023/03/14/fyi-navigation-section-of-new-site-editor-experienced-removed-for-6-2-rc-2/\">dropped from the upcoming release</a> in a somewhat unusual turn of events this late in the release cycle. The feature will remain in the Gutenberg plugin and will be iterated on for a future core release. Users will still be able to manage their menus within the block settings of the Navigation block. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Navigation section was added in Gutenberg 15.1, the last release to be rolled into 6.2, and the one with the least amount of time to be tested.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;After being added and as the beta cycle continued, various bugs and refinements started adding up,&#8221; Editor Triage Co-Lead Anne McCarthy said. &#8220;In particular, the top pain points revolved around which menu appears (and how to change it), needing a better description of what this newer section did, and improving the general experience of adding links from that section.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>McCarthy published a video showing what has been removed: </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>The conversation leading to this decision was spread across many PRs, issues, and Slack conversations, so it became difficult to track. McCarthy cited a dozen of the related issues and PR&#8217;s, including page links being buried in the inserter, confusion around which menu is pulled into the panel, and many other loose ends that do not provide a good experience for users.</p>\n\n\n\n<p> &#8220;Even with trying to lock the experience further down, bugs continued to pop up and the experience isn’t polished enough to move forward with,&#8221; she said. &#8220;This led to a decision amongst Core Editor Tech, Core Editor Triage, and the Design lead ahead of WordPress 6.2 RC 2 to remove that was then <a href=\"https://wordpress.slack.com/archives/C04JZ199XPG/p1678728808778249\">shared with the wider release squad</a>.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The <a href=\"https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/pull/49043\">PR to remove the feature</a> was merged 13 hours ago and now the navigation panel will only be visible if using the Gutenberg plugin. Anyone who is creating documentation or educational resources for WordPress should be aware that those related to the navigation panel may need to be udpated.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>WordPress 6.2 is now just two weeks away from being released on March 28, 2023. <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/test/2023/02/07/help-test-wordpress-6-2/\">Testing</a> and <a href=\"https://translate.wordpress.org/projects/wp/dev\">translation</a> are still needed to ensure the official release will be ready for the world of WordPress users.</p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Tue, 14 Mar 2023 18:58:08 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"Sarah Gooding\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:30;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:53:\"WordPress.org blog: WordPress 6.2 Release Candidate 2\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:35:\"https://wordpress.org/news/?p=14640\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:69:\"https://wordpress.org/news/2023/03/wordpress-6-2-release-candidate-2/\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:4643:\"<p>Here it is: the second release candidate (RC2) for WordPress 6.2 is ready! </p>\n\n\n\n<p>WordPress 6.2 is scheduled for release on March 28, 2023—which is only two weeks away.

Not only does it tell your customers what you do, but it gives you credibility. WordPress is the best website option, but what will it set you back? The WordPress website cost to develop question isn’t so cut and dry.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Eventually, you have to talk about cost.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you’re a consultant, you’ve been asked how much your services cost. And you have to make some decisions:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li>What services am I providing?</li>\n\n\n\n<li>How many hours do I think this will take?</li>\n\n\n\n<li>How much is this worth to the client from a business perspective?</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Does the client have money? How about a business plan?</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Should I charge hourly or by the project?</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Is this a one-off thing, or is there potential for a long-term relationship?</li>\n\n\n\n<li>How busy am I? Do I need this job? Do I want it?</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p>These questions are important. The answers are critical. Gauging the client is vital. Every interaction with the client helps you learn more about them and the project and affects the cost.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Cost often also depends on the market and location. For the purpose of this post, we’re assuming we’re talking to an American audience in U.S. dollars.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"develop\">How Much Should a Custom WordPress Website Cost to Develop?</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Brian has built websites or been part of website projects — all on WordPress — ranging in cost from less than $1,000 to more than $100,000 for complete websites.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So, in short: It always depends.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This differentiation is why we can’t ballpark it for you.

Brian ranks sites in complexity like this:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Simple Blog.</strong> Archives and single post views only. A pretty typical layout.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Complex Blog.</strong> A bunch of “out of the box” styles for various templates. It requires attention to detail on archives, single posts, and other stuff like post formats.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Brochure Site.</strong> Fairly standard but custom home page design and page layout. Stock archive/blog setup with little to no customizations.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Marketing Site</strong>. A mashup between a simple brochure and a complicated blog. It requires more designs, and the home page might be a little more advanced than the simple brochure.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>E-Commerce Site.</strong> It could be a mix of any of the websites above plus all the needs in e-commerce (like cart/account/checkout views and tons of configuration considerations). This type of project is often a huge PM bump as well.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Small Business Site.</strong> Similar to a marketing site, but often includes a couple of custom content types that require design and code, like events, testimonials, services, etc.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Large Company Site.</strong> Big business websites are like regular business websites, but more. They often have many custom content types, advanced searching needs, tons of content, and some fancy user permissions needs. And, of course, potentially much more.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Non-Profit or Advocacy Site.</strong> Non-profit and advocacy sites are the holy grail of wanting everything on a budget. These are difficult to keep in scope because they often have the exact needs of big businesses without the budgets.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Large Scale Site. </strong>You can take any of these types of websites and then say you need it to handle millions of page views per month without breaking a sweat. A whole new layer of complexity comes into play.</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p>The hours it takes to build these different websites can vary tremendously. It depends on the consultant’s experience, whether they’ve done similar work before, how many “gotchas” appear in the project, how particular the client is about any given feature, and more.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"intodevelopment\">Understanding What Goes into Development</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Not all websites are created equal, so not all websites will take the same time and work to create. Here are some factors to consider related to the website development process.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Static vs. Dynamic Websites</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Static websites are the easiest types of sites to maintain and build. They’re faster for users because they require little back-end processing, and the server only retrieves the requested files. Static sites make it challenging to execute a site-wide change because they require you to update each HTML file.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Dynamic sites display different information to each visitor. The visitor’s location, time zone, personal preferences, and habits determine the content. This feature creates a more tailored and interactive experience. Instead of building one page that stays the same, web servers build these personalized pages when users request pages. Dynamic sites build these pages on server-side scripting languages like PHP, Python, or Ruby.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Depending on which type of site you need, you may have to work with different developers. Some common types of development include:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Front-End Development.</strong> The practice of producing CSS, HTML, or JavaScript for a website that the user sees and interacts with directly.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Back-End Development.</strong> Working with server-side software to make sure the site is functioning correctly. Backend development focuses on databases, architecture, and servers.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Database Development.</strong> The type of development that focuses on design, programming, construction, and implementation of new databases and modifying existing databases.&nbsp;</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"cost\">Factors Affecting Website Development Cost</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Each website project is unique, and the factors surrounding each project help determine the website cost to develop.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Factors that affect every project:</h3>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Level of Complexity.</strong> More pages take more time and money to build. Plus, parent and child pages can complicate the process.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Design Requirements. </strong>Some websites need special features and customization. The more design requirements for a specific project, the more it will cost.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Platforms and Technologies. </strong>If the project requires the developer to integrate technologies into the website, it adds to the time and cost to build. While many technologies make integrations easy with API keys, not all companies can quickly provide that to their web designer.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Functionality. </strong>Plugins can be relatively inexpensive, but setting them and ensuring they work well together can take a lot of time.&nbsp;</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Security.</strong> You can add different levels of security to websites. The costs can be a one-time fee or ongoing. For any e-commerce site, continuous security monitoring is crucial.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Maintenance and Updates.</strong> The developer will need to add new components to sites, and regular maintenance ensures everything functions probably and is consistently updated.</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"businesses\">Considerations for Small Businesses</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>If you’re a small business owner needing a website, there are some unique factors to consider before you approach a developer.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Factors that affect small business projects:</h3>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Budget. </strong>Knowing the limitations of your budget is crucial. This knowledge will help you choose the best web developer for you while also giving you realistic expectations about the type of website you’ll receive.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Timeline. </strong>The more complex a website is, the longer it takes to develop. Plus, if you have a lot of old website content that needs to be accounted for, it can add development time.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Outsourcing.</strong> When you create a website in-house, you have more control of the process and final product. But when you outsource, you don’t have to worry about paying full-time salary and benefits to the developer or tying up team members with the project.</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"website\">Estimating the Cost to Develop a Website</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>An estimate takes time. Whether that time is in a paid discovery or a sunk cost the consultant takes on themselves is a different matter. Either way, estimates are expensive because they’re time-consuming. And if a consultant spends a week on an estimate or proposal, they’ll put that cost into the proposal somewhere.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 id=\"timeline\">Estimate Cost and Timeline&nbsp;</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>There are some broad brush typical price ranges we can establish for you. Let’s start by segmenting based on who you’re working with. Basically, working with a freelancer will generally be cheaper than working with an agency. Agencies have more overhead, padding built in, concern about cash flow, and generally just tend to be a bit more expensive.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you work with an agency, the risk of them falling off the map is generally lower, but they move slower too. And you’ll often have to deal with changing contacts as the project progresses (from sales to design to development to maintenance).</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you work with a freelancer, your risks are a bit higher that they’ll disappear someday. It means vetting them is even more important than with an agency. But they also tend to move quickly and don’t juggle as many projects simultaneously. You also benefit from working with (typically) one person who knows everything about your project, and you don’t feel like you’re constantly getting bounced around between people.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It’s possible to have a great relationship with a freelancer or agency. Which route is better typically depends on the client’s mentality and requirements.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 id=\"views\">Pricing Views&nbsp;</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>It’s generally good to estimate how many unique views a website has to consider how much it will cost.</p>\n\n\n\n<h4>Unique views are:</h4>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li>The home page</li>\n\n\n\n<li>The archive page — although it could be category, search, and more, combined in one unique view</li>\n\n\n\n<li>The blog “post” page</li>\n\n\n\n<li>The generic “page” template, though it can be mashed with the post view</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Custom page templates — like fancy about us pages or a key landing page</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Custom post types — sometimes in the traditional archive/singular sense and other times the way it sits within another view, like how an FAQ content type may fit into a regular page</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Variable sidebars within sections of the website</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p>Unique views aren’t always evident. Depending on how discovery conversations go with the client, you can figure out more necessary unique views.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>What’s essential about unique views is that they’re excellent for estimating design time, and they can help guide estimating development time.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If a unique view requires a comp (design preview for the client), then that’s a relatively set number of required hours for design. If it doesn’t require a comp, it’s still best to build in time for the designer to do a quality check after it’s developed, so they can make sure it looks good.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Designing a unique view from the ground up could take a designer between four and 10 hours, depending on the complexity. For certain complex or innovative views, that number could hit upward of 20 hours just for design.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Also, design requires a base set of hours to establish the overall tone of the website and to design things rarely considered with unique views, like the header, footer, and overall style guide. The website&#8217;s base elements and style guide could easily range between 10 and 100 hours. It’s a ridiculous range, but it&#8217;s necessary.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So, we’ve established a framework for pricing the design of unique views. Developing them is a different story.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>You must carefully consider development. Generally, every design hour should get a development hour to go with it. But development hours can easily break that rule, especially when developing something complex.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Development hours can be <em>literally anything</em> for wholly custom functionality, which is entirely outside this post&#8217;s scope. Development can cost millions of dollars.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 id=\"content\">Pricing Content&nbsp;</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>With WordPress, you can add as many posts and pages as you want. But the more posts or pages the client’s existing website has (and expects to transfer to the new site), the more complex the new project will be.</p>\n\n\n\n<h4>Some levels to consider when pricing content:</h4>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Less than 10 pages </strong>&#8211;<strong> </strong>No big deal</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>More than 30 pages</strong> &#8211; Start thinking about structure</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Hierarchical pages (lots of parent &gt; child page relationships)</strong> &#8211; Require strategic thinking time</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Hundreds of pages</strong> &#8211; Either a problem or a lot of strategy and design consideration</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Thousands of blog posts, taxonomies (category/tag handling), and searches</strong> &#8211; Probably cost more</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>A lot of content</strong> &#8211; Navigation needs to be uniquely priced&nbsp;</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Multi-author blog</strong> &#8211; Needs special consideration</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Pages or posts need editorial workflow (section management, change or publishing approval, etc.)</strong> &#8211; Need special consideration</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Current CMS isn’t WordPress &#8211; </strong>Migration requires special language and details to make it happen</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Current CMS is WordPress</strong> &#8211; Understand plugins or custom code potentially creating shortcodes or weird content handling (maybe with custom fields) or what other bad practices may be present</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<h3 id=\"time\">Pricing Time</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Time is a huge factor to consider when building a website. Developers need to charge for the time a project will take to complete.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Both freelancers and agencies factor time into their pricing. So the time spent researching a project, bidding on it, and meeting with the clients is built into the pricing structure. It’s not just the cost of the time spent working on WordPress website development, though that is the bulk of the cost.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 id=\"factors\">Pricing Site Factors&nbsp;</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Every website development project is different, and the goals of each website owner vary as well. The developer must consider each specification when determining the website&#8217;s cost.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Additionally, the client is a huge factor in price. In short, if a client is going to be difficult, it affects the client multiplier on the overall project cost.</p>\n\n\n\n<h4>Client qualities that end up costing money are when the client:</h4>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li>Doesn’t have a single point of contact (multiple people always have to be looped into communication)</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Has to get some form of committee approval</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Isn’t decisive or is incapable of playing the “consultant advocate” role well internally</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Has a lot of red tape for decision making</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Payment schedules are awful (payment may take months)</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Is prone to huge email threads about small issues</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Wants daily or frequent phone calls or meetings</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Doesn’t have a clear business plan and will require a lot of advising</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p>These are mostly people and organizational things. They have little to do with the actual project.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Let’s say the work for a project will be about $20,000. Add in these client qualities that could get costly from a project management perspective and apply them to the overall cost.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In a $20,000 project, it’s not uncommon for $5,000 of that to be project management costs. If there are enough concerns to warrant 50% higher PM costs, the project gets a $2,500, or 12.5%, increase in overall project cost.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Looking for client qualities that trigger higher costs is vital as a consultant. For potential clients, remember that your qualities (organizational and behavioral) affect your consultant’s price.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"freelancerdevelopment\">Working with a Freelancer for Website Development&nbsp;</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Freelancers can be an affordable option for website development, but not everyone enjoys working with them, and they aren&#8217;t the right fit for every project.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Pros and Cons of Freelancers</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Working with freelancers can be good if you have a quick turnaround time. Unlike agencies, freelancers tend to work on one project at a time, so they can focus on your website until it’s finished. You’ll also only communicate with the freelancer during the project, unlike with agencies where you may speak to different departments in various project stages.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But freelancers don’t always have the same schedule availability since they’re a smaller business operation. So, if you need updates in the future, it may take a long time to get on the freelancer’s schedule.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Also, many freelancers work alone, leading to a more unstructured process, which means you may not know the project&#8217;s stage. The freelancer you work with will also likely be acting as their own project manager, so you won’t necessarily get as many updates or information about the project&#8217;s status while they’re working.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>When a Freelancer is a Good Fit&nbsp;</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>In general, freelancers are great for jobs that fit the following criteria:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li>Are small enough for one person to handle&nbsp;</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Have a tight timeline, and you want them to start quickly</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Are fine with informal communication channels&nbsp;</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Don&#8217;t need big contractor agreements, insurance, or other common big-business requirements</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"agencydevelopment\">Working with an Agency for Website Development&nbsp;</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Agencies are a more established alternative to working with freelancers. They tend to have greater resources and an established process.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Pros and Cons of Agencies&nbsp;</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Working with agencies can be good for a lot of reasons. Because they specialize in what you’re paying for, you have the potential to build a long-term relationship with them and will be able to come back to them for future projects. You’ll also have a project or client manager to usher you through the process and explain what’s going on with your website. Plus, agencies have dedicated processes, so you know nothing will be left out or forgotten.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But there are still limitations to working with agencies. They work with a large number of clients, so that means you may have a waiting period before they begin your project. It can also lead to a slower project turnaround time.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>As your project progresses, you’ll have different points of contact for the various stages.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Working with an agency also can be expensive since they have more overhead costs.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>When an Agency is a Good Fit&nbsp;</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>In general, agencies are better when you:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li>Don’t want to risk your consultant disappearing</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Are comfortable with a project structure you don’t define and following their process</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Can handle a multi-month project that takes two to six months</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Don’t mind waiting 30 to 90 days to start until you can fit into their schedule&nbsp;</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Want a dedicated project manager</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Have a large-scope or fast-turnaround project that requires multiple people working full-time on it</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"rates\">Comparing Freelancer vs. Agency Rates</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>For most projects, the consultant has to estimate the time it will take them to build and charge <em>at least</em> that. So the consultant probably isn’t charging much more than their cost.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Whether the consultant is an agency or a freelancer, the developer only spends about half their day on the project. Also, that number is probably higher for your average web worker in an agency. It still works as an average because managers and PMs typically won’t hit 50%, and their time may not even factor into direct costs.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Assume the freelancer is billing an end client, not subcontracting to an agency where their costs decrease considerably due to less PM and consistent work.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Finally, utilize these hourly rates as if it’s for billable work and known costs. So, if the rate is $100 per hour and the design will take 50 hours and the development will take 50 hours, and you build in 25 hours for project management, it would be 125 hours, and the project would cost $12,500. Profits, overhead, and everything else are built into the internal hourly rate — just like if someone were billing the client hourly for the work.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Understanding Special Cases&nbsp;</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Freelancers and agencies also break their own rules all the time. A great example is when you get an inquiry from a big brand. If it’s a competitive bid, and a consultant wants that brand as a featured client, they could easily drop their rates by a third or more to get it — hoping that that brand will make other folks want to work with them down the road.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Sometimes this is effective. Other times it’s a terrible idea. Referrals can come from anywhere, and generally, bending your rates for a brand name is a bad idea, even though it&#8217;s tempting.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Other times, consultants break their own rules or don’t follow their internal rates. Consultants may charge less if it’s a client they work with repeatedly and know the true costs better. Consultants may charge less for non-profit organizations, with a retainer, if work is slow or if they get emotionally invested in the bid. The list of ways to break the guidelines goes on and on.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Common Freelancer Rates</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Freelance WordPress website developers today make $30 to $175 an hour, with the average developer charging $70 an hour. Freelancers with good experience, who are more in demand, and those with reputations as specialists charge more for their services.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Common Agency Rates</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>WordPress website development agencies charge anywhere from $3,000 to $75,000 or more to build a website, depending on your needs, their reputation, and the size of the market they serve. The better their reputation and the bigger, more high-profile projects they’ve completed in the past, the more they can charge. They also can charge more if they have a niche expertise.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Market size is the difference between working in big towns or small cities (small market), cities that are thriving but not huge (medium market), or the type of city that’s got pro sports teams and more than a million people (large market). The bigger the market, the more an agency can charge. Agencies in mega markets, like New York and San Francisco, can charge much more.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"started\">How to Get Your Website Development Started</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Before you contact a web developer to build your website, there are some things to do to prepare. This list will help you be more intentional about your web development project and ensure you get what you need.</p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Assess Any Current Site Failings.</strong> What do you wish your site could do that it doesn’t? Are there any functions you absolutely need to add?</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Identify Your Goals.</strong> Know what you want from a new site. This direction will help your developer build a better site for you.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Create a Comprehensive List of Needs. </strong>This list will help your developer create a website that works best for your business and help you determine what’s most important during the web development process.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Determine Your Budget.</strong> Knowing how much money you have to work with will help you choose a developer and understand what features you can afford.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Research Freelancers or Agencies. </strong>Think about your timeline and how you’d like the project to proceed. Find a developer that will work well with you.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Track Progress and Stay Connected.</strong> Know where your website is in the development stages. This tracking will help you stay on top of the project.</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<h2>Do You Want to Learn More About WordPress Development?</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Are you a WordPress pro or someone who works with WordPress pros?

Patchstack is tracking a significant increase in vulnerabilities reported in 2022:</p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\">\n<p>In 2022 we saw&nbsp;<strong>328% more security bugs reported</strong>&nbsp;in WordPress plugins – we added&nbsp;<strong>4,528</strong>&nbsp;confirmed security bugs to our database, compared to&nbsp;<strong>1,382 in 2021</strong>.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>Similar to previous years, the majority of these security bugs were found in plugins (93%), followed by themes (6.7%), and WordPress core (0.6%).</p>\n\n\n\n<p>These numbers were sourced from public data from Patchstack and other security companies and researchers in the WordPress ecosystem. The total number of vulnerabilities comes from the three official CNAs in the WordPress space that are authorized to assign CVE IDs to new security vulnerabilities and to whom researchers report issues. These include Patchstack, Automattic (WPscan) and WordFence. Patchstack CEO Oliver Sild said some of the vulnerabilities were also independently published elsewhere or reported directly to MITRE.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The report emphasized that the increase in the number of vulnerabilities reported means that ecosystem is becoming more secure as the result of more security issues being found and patched.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Another small improvement over last year is the percentage of critical security bugs that never received a patch. In 2022, that number was 26% versus 29% in 2021. Critical vulnerabilities were better addressed this year but Sild said so far it&#8217;s not a significant change that they would connect with any trend yet.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;We still think it shows a big problem, which is that some plugins are unsupported or abandoned and do not receive timely patches,&#8221; he said.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Solving the problem of developers abandoning their work is challenging, and many users have no idea how to select plugins that are more likely to be supported. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;I think it’s important to be transparent,&#8221; Sild said. &#8220;It is also okay that projects come to an end. I just recently told my colleague that &#8216;when someone builds a new plugin, they should keep in mind that someone might actually use it.&#8217; It kind of stuck with me, because even if the plugin developer has moved on and is not working on the project anymore, there still might be people who rely on it.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Sild said users often get left in the dark because WordPress core only shows if an update is available. If a plugin gets closed by WordPress.org due to an unpatched security issue, users don&#8217;t get notified.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;It’s something we try to improve together with our partners such as other security plugins and hosting companies,&#8221; he said. &#8220;Communication is key. We recently also created a free service for plugin developers called &#8216;managed vulnerability disclosure program&#8217; shortly mVDP.  The goal is to help plugin developers adopt more mature security practices and show users that they take security seriously.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Other notable insights from the whitepaper include a breakdown of WordPress security bugs by severity. In 2022, the majority of vulnerabilities (84%) were classified as Medium severity, with a smaller percentage of High severity (11%) and Critical (2%).</p>\n\n\n\n<img />\n\n\n\n<p>Of the most popular plugins (over 1 million installs) that had security issues, only five contained high severity bugs. The two with the highest CVSS score vulnerabilities were Elementor and Essential Add-ons for Elementor, followed by UpdraftPlus WordPress Backup, One Click Demo Import, and MonsterInsights.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The whitepaper highlights a few other trends, including hosting companies alerting their customers to vulnerabilities, the growth of the security research community, and increased security awareness within the WordPress ecosystem.

Pfefferle, who is also the author of the <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/webmention/\">Webmention</a> plugin, said his new role is to see how Automattic&#8217;s products can benefit from open protocols like ActivityPub.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In 2021, Automattic CEO Matt Mullenweg indicated that he would be interested in <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2022/11/21/tumblr-to-add-support-for-activitypub-the-social-protocol-powering-mastodon-and-other-apps/\">having Tumblr support the ActivityPub protocol</a> for a greater level of interoperability across networks like Mastodon and others using the same protocol. That is still in the works, but WordPress sites already have this capability through the plugin.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;ActivityPub and a lot of other Open Web Plugins (like the Webmention plugin) were spare time projects, so I was not looking for an acquisition,&#8221; Pfefferle said.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;When Matt announced that Tumblr wants to implement ActivityPub on Twitter, I asked why not WordPress, so I came in contact with Automattic and they offered me the opportunity to work full time on the plugin and other Open Web projects.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The ActivityPub plugin makes it possible for readers to follow a WordPress  site in the fediverse using the ActivityPub protocol. This includes Mastodon, one of the most popular platforms using the protocol, and other platforms like <a href=\"https://pleroma.social/\">Pleroma</a>, <a href=\"https://friendi.ca/\">Friendica</a>, <a href=\"https://hubzilla.org/\">HubZilla</a>, <a href=\"https://pixelfed.org/\">Pixelfed</a>, <a href=\"https://socialhome.network/\">SocialHome</a>, and <a href=\"https://join.misskey.page/\">Misskey</a>. For those using Mastodon, this plugin will automatically send posts to the network and replies to it will become comments on the post.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Last March, the ActivityPub plugin had just 700 users. Today it has grown to more than 2,000 active installs. Although it is not yet widely used, it has gotten more exposure since Elon Musk bought Twitter.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;Thanks to Elon Musk, the number of downloads from my ActivityPub (WordPress) plugin and <a href=\"https://mastodon.social/@pfefferle\">my followers on Mastodon</a> have increased at least tenfold!&#8221; Pfefferle said in a post on his blog in January 2023. &#8220;This inspired me to work more actively on the plugin again and some great changes came about.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Most recently, Pfefferle added a new onboarding screen with recommended plugins, added the published date to author profiles, and added outgoing mentions, among other features.</p>\n\n\n\n<img />\n\n\n\n<p>Pfefferle said he thinks the idea of the acquisition is not to have the protocol merged into core, but to &#8220;guarantee that it will stay open source and to maybe make it a canonical plugin.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>As more social networks unite on open protocols, it won&#8217;t matter where you choose to create your home on the web. Interoperability between apps allows people to post from whatever network they enjoy, creating a richer, more diverse web. Automattic&#8217;s support of the ActivityPub plugin ensures WordPress&#8217; place in the fediverse, where blogs will not isolated islands but rather interconnected as many were in the early days of blogging.

Here we go.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[Josepha Haden Chomphosy 00:00:29]</p>\n\n\n\n<p>All right, my WordPress wonders; it&#8217;s time to join me for one of my gentle rants on basic leadership principles. Today we&#8217;re talking about the importance of routine and predictability in everyday life. But don&#8217;t worry, I&#8217;m gonna tie it all together with WordPress, too. So by now you&#8217;re probably aware that I don&#8217;t really consider myself one of those “born leaders.”&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[Josepha Haden Chomphosy 00:01:00]&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Over the years, I&#8217;ve put a lot of effort into researching characteristics of good leaders and general leadership methods overall. But one of the things I encountered early on in my leadership learning journey was the concept of routine.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>As with most leadership practices I hold, routine has more than one purpose. From a very pragmatic standpoint, routines provide predictability and the more predictable something is, the lower the cognitive load becomes, which in turn lets you use your thinking power for something better. For instance, if you know that in every check-in with your team lead, she&#8217;s gonna ask you what you were proud to have shipped last week, what you want to ship next week, and what things stand in the way of your plans, then you know that that is what you have to prepare for.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The knowledge work, the thinking part. The thinking part stops being, what is my team lead going to ask me and starts being what is the problem that she can help me solve?&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[Josepha Haden Chomphosy 00:02:00]&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But from a more human standpoint, that kind of predictability helps us to understand when something that happened is out of the ordinary. Whether it&#8217;s a notification of a comment left on your blog or syntactical highlighting that lets you know that you&#8217;ve written something that&#8217;s out of voice or against grammar standards, it just lets you know that something is unusual there and deserves your attention.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Now for me, this has a lot of applications across the WordPress project. There are the obvious things like the cadence of our major release cycles or our notification system, which honestly could use a bit of TLC, a little bit of elbow grease.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But there are also less obvious things that this idea still applies to simply because of the way our brains work, the information architecture on our sites, for instance. It should make sense visually and semantically because that makes it easy for us to skim and predict where the highest value content is for us. Or the user interface across the back end of our software.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[Josepha Haden Chomphosy 00:03:00]&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Having familiar tasks or actions across any type of content or area of content makes it easier for a site maintainer to flow from one area of a site to the next, fixing things as they find them without necessarily having to stop and put down their hammer and pick up a screwdriver or whatever metaphor works for you. Or if you&#8217;re doing more nuanced work, like put down your timpani mallets and pick up your xylophone mallets.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So, yeah, consistency. Consistency is the topic of today&#8217;s gentle rant. I get really worked up about it because I feel like consistency ends up being this euphemism for being boring. But I honestly believe that it&#8217;s the consistency and the dependability that make it clear what is supposed to be exciting, the things that are different enough that they merit our attention.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[Josepha Haden Chomphosy 00:03:38]&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Which, fortunately, now brings us to our small list of big things. It&#8217;s actually a pretty big list today and also a bunch of pretty big things. So first thing to know, there was an additional beta added to this release cycle.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[Josepha Haden Chomphosy 00:04:00]&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It was beta five; it came out last week, I think. There was a bit of a regression that we worked our way through. And so RC1, release candidate one, is going to be postponed a little bit because of that. But don&#8217;t wait until RC to start testing, obviously RC is tomorrow, so that means you get to test, like, today!</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The second thing on our small list of big things is that we have the WordPress 20th anniversary coming up. That&#8217;s May 27th. And you can join in the celebrations. So at WordPress&#8217;s 10th anniversary and 15th anniversary, we had like a big, ongoing global set of parties, like Meetup events got together and made cakes, or did a concert, or did a hackathon for various reasons.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Like they all got together on May 27th or thereabouts and did some really fun, like celebration of how far WordPress has gotten them and how far they hope to be able to go with WordPress.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[Josepha Haden Chomphosy 00:05:00]&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So if you are from the before times WordCamp kind of organizing timeframe, you know that we always consider WordCamps to be like an annual celebration of the excellence of your community and how much you all come together and how different you are as part of this overall big WordPress-y thingy.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>All right. Third item that we have is that, I know that I mentioned this in the last WP Briefing as well, but we have another session of the diverse and inclusive WordPress events coming up that&#8217;s happening on March 16th. So coming up really fast, we&#8217;ll put a link to that in the show notes as well.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And the final thing, I don&#8217;t remember what list number we&#8217;re at, but the final thing is that there is a proposal out there right now to modify the events and news widget that we use inside the WordPress dashboard. If you&#8217;re not familiar with it, it is a place where all of the local-to-you Meetup events get listed.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[Josepha Haden Chomphosy 00:06:00]&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It&#8217;s where all of the news items from various WordPress media outlets get published. We just have a link to it there. And so, we would like to make some changes to that so that we&#8217;re able to include not only specific location types of events but also events that are location agnostic because they&#8217;re online but might have a specific, identifying niche that you particularly find interesting.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So it might be for Spanish speakers or for women in particular, or whatever it might be. There&#8217;s a proposal out for that. We&#8217;ll put a link to that in the show notes as well.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And that, my friends, is your small list of big things. Thanks for tuning in today for the WordPress Briefing. I&#8217;m your host, Josepha Haden Chomphosy, and I&#8217;ll see you again in a couple of weeks.&nbsp;</p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Mon, 13 Mar 2023

In today&#8217;s episode, we will talk about WordPress 6.2 Preview, Gutenberg 15.2 and 15.3. I&#8217;m your host, Birgit Pauli-Haack, curator at the Gutenberg Times and WordPress developer advocate and a full-time core contributor to the WordPress Open Source Project. I&#8217;m thrilled to have with me today Rich Tabor, product manager for the WordPress Open Source project and part of Automattic&#8217;s Five for the Future program. Hi, Rich, thank you so much for taking the time out of your very busy week to be here with us and talk to our listeners. How are you?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Rich Tabor</em>: Hey, thanks, Birgit. I&#8217;m doing pretty well. I can&#8217;t complain, to be honest. Thanks for having me on this show. It&#8217;s been a long time coming here.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Yeah, I think so, for two years or so.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Rich Tabor</em>: That&#8217;s right.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: In and out. For many who have known you in the community, you are an early adopter of the block editor, you and Jeffrey Carandang worked on several things together in the early days, and that&#8217;s about five years ago now. Since then, you presented at WordCamps, virtual and in-person. I remember your talk at WordCamp Atlanta. No, was it Atlanta in 2019?&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Rich Tabor</em>: Yeah, it was.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: &#8230; Boston &#8217;19 that I saw you, but both of them are fine. Also, your talk on WordCamp US in 2021 and last year, so there&#8217;s a lot you did in the last five years.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Rich Tabor</em>: I&#8217;ve been exploring block editing since I guess before it landed in WordPress. WordCamp US in 2018, I believe, is really what kicked me into gear on designing and building block experiences for Gutenberg. Since then, I&#8217;ve been building, launching, and sharing my knowledge however I can. Code Blocks, the project I did with Jeffrey Carandang, it&#8217;s now under the GoDaddy brand, I was one of the early explorations and just a really great entry to learning the ins and outs of Gutenberg. I personally learn best by doing something real and releasing an open source block plugin for folks to actually use was certainly the catalyst to where I am today.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: I used Code Blocks together with Atomic Blocks. Michael Allison was pretty much also on the forefront and it must have been before 2018, though, WordCamp US 2018, because I think wasn&#8217;t that there when you already sold Code Blocks to GoDaddy?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Rich Tabor</em>: I think it was January 2018. In 2018, it was the like, &#8220;Hey, I need to get serious,&#8221; moment. Maybe it was &#8217;17, I don&#8217;t know, but right around there, it was like the, &#8220;Hey, let&#8217;s learn this and let&#8217;s do this.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Now, as a product builder, what do you find now fascinating about the WordPress, the block editor, the Site Editor, and this potential to empower folks?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Rich Tabor</em>: I think that potential is huge. The WordPress experience is changing and evolving, and it&#8217;s slowly becoming more intuitive and better to use on the site level, not just on the post editor level. I just think that the opportunities for empowering those creatives and publishers and just people who want to share something and have a little ownership in it on the web is paramount to the future of the web, and I&#8217;m just so thankful to be a part of this time in WordPress.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: It&#8217;s been quite exciting to see what people come up in their creativity, what they do with the sites, what they do with the design tools, how they manage the space and the spacings and the dimension controls. There are quite a few additional explorations there that are totally new to WordPress, nobody really, apart from additional third-party page builder, but to have that right into the software is such an amazing product. I&#8217;m really happy about that. I&#8217;m glad we are finally here.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Rich Tabor</em>: We&#8217;re getting there, yes.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: We are there. To the Site Editor, do you think it&#8217;s ready to have people use it in production and all that?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Rich Tabor</em>: Oh yeah, certainly. I think that there&#8217;s always improvements to be made and there&#8217;s still a lot of lines to draw between the dots to connect a lot of these experiences, but overall, as a holistic editing experience for your site, it&#8217;s really been fine-tuned in the last couple of maybe half a year or so, since the release of 6.1, it&#8217;s really tightened up quite a bit and there&#8217;s more to do, but I&#8217;m pretty stoked at where we&#8217;re headed.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Me too, me too. We will talk about it when we go to 15.3, I had another great experience with the new tools that are in there, but first of all, we have some announcements, well, actually one announcement, but it has multiple facets there.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Announcements</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<p>There is an official WordPress Developer Blog and in February, there were six new posts published there and one of them was a block theme resource roundup by Daisy Olsen. If you are WordPress developer, either you have already experience with block themes, you get some resources there, as well as if you just get started and want to have one page where you can have a startup page, so to speak, get started and get to the resources that are available on wordpress.org, all through learn, through the Developer Blog, through documentation, the theme handbook, it&#8217;s a great roundup of all those resources.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The next one is a little bit is a topic that is really high on our minds and finally, we have a post up there, and you probably can talk about that, as well, it&#8217;s about the intrinsic design theming and rethinking how to do design with WordPress. Justin Tadlock wrote this post because there were a lot of questions about the responsiveness of WordPress, that&#8217;s one thing. The other one is many people that come from other page builders, they miss their viewpoints, the three viewpoints that they have been using for the last 8 or 10 years. But intrinsic design is more the fluid typography, so no matter what the screen size is, it adapts to the screen size and there&#8217;s also fluid spacing that&#8217;s now part of WordPress. Is that enough, what do you think, Rich?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Rich Tabor</em>: I think you hit it on pretty good. It&#8217;s the idea that when you design something in WordPress, in this case, that it inherits the responsive nature of the viewport, instead of you having to actually declare those values, like instead of declaring that you want to font size smaller on mobile or even a column going to Stack on mobile versus on desktop, maybe it&#8217;s side-by-side. It is something that intrinsically will Stack whenever it becomes too small to render side-by-side, so trying to figure out those controls, it is tricky to be honest, but there&#8217;s been a lot of improvements in that direction and overall, it does simplify the editing experience quite a bit. That doesn&#8217;t mean that we&#8217;re there, by any means, on the controls that we need, but if we do improve some of the Row and Stack capabilities and some of this intrinsic design methodology in WordPress, I think it will move forward to the point where it&#8217;s less of a concept that you have to think about and more of just a way that you expect it to work.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: I can see that those viewpoints, that&#8217;s more for designers rather than your site owners or those who just want to build a website and hope that it&#8217;s all working out of the box, and those concepts can get really confusing, but also very hard to manage. I saw a plugin that was built on the block editor, but they had six viewpoints for every design decision. I don&#8217;t think that&#8217;s where we want to go as a product, pretty much, or for the normal user or even the design user, the theme developer, that they have to be so granular. It&#8217;s not so much thinking about the first version of it, but also where did I change this? Is it in the viewpoint of this one or this one or this one?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>With the proliferation of the screen sizes, they go smaller, but they also get bigger, I think it&#8217;s going to be harder and harder to actually hit the right size for the viewpoints. I think there was a very interesting article from Justin Tadlock and there&#8217;s definitely a lot of discussion also on there, so dear listeners, you can definitely spend a half an hour or so reading that and also reading the discussions. Another article on the Developer Blog explains the difference between the static and dynamic blocks. Joni Halibi wrote this one. I know it was a topic close to her heart. She&#8217;s a developer at Georgetown University.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Rich Tabor</em>: That&#8217;s right, yes.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Thank you. I heard her talking about it, so I asked her if she wanted to write about it. It&#8217;s definitely a great rundown of the pros and cons of static and dynamic blocks. Dynamic blocks are rendered with PHP, static blocks are everything the editor, as well as frontend is coming from Post Content from the JavaScript. I think the biggest hurdle is the updating during development and after development. I&#8217;m jumping over the other lists there.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>There is just today, Michael Burridge published an article on how to deprecate static blocks and have some version, so you have a version of a block on the site and you use it multiple times and then a new update comes for the block. Sometimes when you open up the post into the editor and there was a block in there and it wasn&#8217;t deprecated right, it has this error message in there, so something happened with the block kind of thing, and some of you have already seen it, and this prevents that from happening. It&#8217;s not difficult from the mechanics, but it&#8217;s definitely something to think about when you do static block development. How did you feel about that when you came across it in your early days of block development?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Rich Tabor</em>: I feel like that&#8217;s a pointed question. The idea between static and dynamic blocks is really powerful. Dynamic blocks are definitely, I would say, probably the primary use case on most of the more complex blocks that you would build, in particular in third-party situations like rebuilding a custom block for a client, because you don&#8217;t need deprecations at that point. If you need to make changes, you can, because it&#8217;s all rendered in PHP, and the tooling around dynamic blocks has improved quite a bit, as well, with the render.php file that you can load in and it makes templating a much easier process than it was originally. But deprecations are a necessary part of static blocks and they can be a little frustrating just because it sits there forever at that point, but if I&#8217;m building a custom block these days, I probably would lean more on the dynamic side, if possible.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: I can see that. There are some new ideas actually happening that also will be on tap into the dynamic block development there, and we will talk about it on the Gutenberg Changelog when the time is right. Two more posts were launched just recently, one was how to create a custom block that stores Post Meta. That&#8217;s certainly a big question that a lot of people had and Ryan Welcher answers that question nicely, walk you through step-by-step, and explains very much most of the steps that are necessary to make that successful.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And then the other post is converting your short codes to blocks, and that one is from Jonathan Bossenger and he has his use case that he&#8230; It&#8217;s not really a conversion, it&#8217;s recreating something that was a short code into a block and make it more user-friendly. Short codes had their good usage, but with newer modern interfaces, they are just too cumbersome for site users to write all those text strings and not forgetting a comma or something like that, so converting them to blocks is definitely a good way to go about them. Any thoughts about those two problems? It doesn&#8217;t have to be from the articles.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Rich Tabor</em>: I would say they&#8217;re both well-written and good examples of writing tutorials and documentation together, in a sense. There&#8217;s a short code that Jonathan&#8217;s actually converting in real time, you can see and watch it, I think you might be able to listen to part of it, but the idea that you&#8217;re taking a real-world example and converting it, I think is very powerful. And then the same goes for the other one about storing Post Meta with the custom block. I think it&#8217;s very powerful and hasn&#8217;t been done very often, or at least not often enough that&#8217;s front and center, because it really is a powerful way to manipulate Post Meta, but also site options. I think it works very similar if you&#8217;re updating the site options, which is what the site title block does and the Site Logo block. But you could do other options, perhaps, like I experimented with pulling in the WooCommerce phone number into a block, but if you update it there, it also updates it in WooCommerce, again, connecting some of those dots that right now are very disconnected and this is one of those steps in that direction.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Well, that&#8217;s actually a good idea to look beyond the WordPress core and see where connections and integrations are made. We definitely share the links in the show notes that are coming out with this episode or you can just go to the Developer Blog and read through the latest What&#8217;s new for developers? (March 2023). That&#8217;s the second edition of a roundup post of what&#8217;s new not only in a block in the block development, but also for core and the learn places, but it&#8217;s specifically for developers, extenders, plugin developers, theme developers, or agency developers so they can get up to speed very fast.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Community Contributions</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<p>We have, in the section of community contributions, there&#8217;s one new project, the theme team kicked off the community theme project, and I believe, Rich, you were part of it. What can you tell us about it?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Rich Tabor</em>: Yeah, certainly. On March 7th, we had, I think, over 20 people participating in the Hallway Hangout session to discuss it. This community theme project is an interesting way to start really just encouraging experienced and new WordPress contributors to create more themes, in particular, block themes. It was a big learning curve to how block themes are created compared to existing themes, but really they&#8217;re much more of a simple system that&#8217;s design-oriented, so some of the talks were centered around a designing a theme within the editor and not necessarily with a different design tool like Figma, which is a huge challenge, but I really think it will help open up a lot more eyes to the issues that we need to continue resolving within the editor to encourage more of the explorative design work that designers can leverage to build beautiful themes.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>There&#8217;s a Slack channel within Make, it&#8217;s the Core Themes Projects channel, there&#8217;s some discussion there. There&#8217;s a repo, I think it&#8217;s WordPress/community-themes. The idea is that you can start creating themes and submit them as a pull request and collectively, we&#8217;ll all try to help get these situated in the right way, so where we&#8217;re all learning and growing from this experience of building themes together.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: I&#8217;m really excited about this. This started with the theme team, thinking about the latest default team that was 2023, where there was a call for sending in style variations. There was a base theme that was made public very early and then there were, I think, 19 theme designers sent in about 30, almost 40, style variations, of which 10 made it into the final release. But that kind of community collaboration is always very fruitful and very creative and it helps people really learn about things, but also push the boundaries so much more than just brooding alone in your own remote home office. I think that&#8217;s a fantastic way to get the community also in producing more than one theme per year; I hope that is what will come out of it. The theme will all be published under the username of WordPress, so that&#8217;s the new part of it, I would think. Do you already have an idea for a theme that you might want to work on?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Rich Tabor</em>: I&#8217;ve got the bug to redesign my blog again. I love it, but I want to remove some of the barriers to publishing. Featured image, right now, it&#8217;s almost required in my current blog design, and then I want my headings to be a certain lead flow, so I want to try to identify the things that are blocking me from publishing more and start designing in that essence, so it could be more of a thought feed instead of only technical blog posts, in a sense. That&#8217;s my personal project I&#8217;ve been exploring a little bit on.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: I saw that the list of block patterns for the Query Loop actually would probably help you with that, because there are quite a few text-based lists design available now in the Block Pattern Directory, as well as I think that are now coming out, as well.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Rich Tabor</em>: Yeah. There&#8217;s more opinionated design elements to some of these patterns, which I think is great because at the end of the day, if you don&#8217;t want to use a pattern, you don&#8217;t have to use it, but if you do want to use one of these more interesting, opinionated designs, then it&#8217;s a great start to building out the rest of your theme. I&#8217;m really looking forward to even more of the patterns coming down from WordPress.org.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Yeah. Oh, speaking about switching the site up, Felix Arntz, who is a software engineer with Google, shared his experience on doing exactly that, switching his site from a classic theme to a block theme and his post is exactly that, rebuilding my website using block theme. It&#8217;s a very long post; he recounts all the steps in detail that it took him to convert it, and it wasn&#8217;t so much&#8230; It was minimal code editing, he says, in part, but he also had to update his custom blocks, so that&#8217;s part of it. But he also, and that was very interesting for me to read, is that Felix is also a member of the WordPress Performance Team, so what he did was also measuring the performance before and after the redesign and it really piqued my interest, and you definitely should read it, dear listeners. I&#8217;m only Miss Numbers on the podcast, it&#8217;s really hard, but I just wanted to say one number.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>He did two steps. One was just recreating the same pages with the block theme, the header and content and Query Loop and that part and then measured it, and then he did additional tweaking and he actually explains very detailed how he did those. And then with the first step, just moving it over to a block theme, he had an improvement on the LCP, which is the longest content paint, one of the web vitals. He went from something a little over 1 second to 600 milliseconds, so that was an almost 38% improvement of the speed. But when he did the first performance tweaks, he went down to 452 from 1 second to 0.4 second, that&#8217;s an improvement of almost 60%. That was the first time that I actually saw this so very much spelled out and I have a trust in Felix that his numbers are actually averages from multiple tests, he explains that also in his post, but this was a very interesting post in many, many directions. Also, learning more how to do some more performance tweaks was one. I&#8217;ll leave the link in the show notes and definitely go and read it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Rich Tabor</em>: I would just like to echo what Felix writes at the very end. He says, &#8220;Block themes in full site editing, the effort for the Site Editor has evolved quite a bit since it originally launching in 5.9.&#8221; He says, &#8220;Here, I can with confidence say that it was the right decision for me to jump on that train now. If you&#8217;ve tried block themes a while ago and weren&#8217;t satisfied, maybe give it another try.&#8221; I totally agree with that sentiment. Especially if you have a personal blog, I would say just give it a shot, even 2023, put that on there and start designing it within the editor, then start running with it, you can see what happens.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: If you are not a developer and a little bit of hesitant to change something in production or on a live site, definitely be cautious. There is a new tutorial up and I just listened to it a couple days ago with Sarah Snow, she actually did the same thing. She went and replaced her old theme with a new theme and rebuilt her website, but she also walks through how she tried to avoid all the pitfalls to take her site down and all that, so that is also for non-developers, a very good tutorial to look at and to watch.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>What’s Released &#8211; WordPress 6.2</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<p>That brings us to the section of what&#8217;s released? Of course, we start with this week, it was release week with multiple releases.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>One of them was the 6.2 Release Candidate 1 and the contributor published 12 dev notes that are related to the block editor in the Field Guide. The Release Candidate 1 is that point in the release cycle where there is hard string freeze, the Field Guide is published, and the emails go out to plugin and theme developers about what&#8217;s new, that send the Field Guide and also to test their products against the new version so they can figure out all the incompatibilities or make it compatible to the version. The final release is on March 28th, 2023, that&#8217;s, right now, 18 days from today. We are recording this on March 10th. Rich, you were part of the release squad as lead for design, what was your role there, or is your role there, you are not done yet?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Rich Tabor</em>: No, not quite yet.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: We are not done yet.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Rich Tabor</em>: That&#8217;s right. I think there&#8217;s three focuses, especially around this release. But the first, I would say it&#8217;s keeping a general pulse on what&#8217;s coming, what&#8217;s being worked on, keeping contributors focused on delivering that best, optimal WordPress experience that&#8217;s always right there on the horizon. It doesn&#8217;t mean we&#8217;re there today, like I&#8217;ve said a couple times here, but if we set our gaze in that direction, I&#8217;m sure we will continue refining and iterating towards that best experience, so that&#8217;s the first. The second would be the about page. The WordPress about page introduces you to the latest and greatest parts of WordPress that have been put into by all these contributors over the last release.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>That&#8217;s been a fun project working with designers from the design community and really putting together the images and the layout and the structure, even the copy, to make sure that it portrays 6.2 as intended. 6.2 has a lot of new stuff in it and it&#8217;s hard to distill that into one page, but it&#8217;s been a welcome challenge, for sure. And then the last bit, this release, we did a product demo of 6.2, I did it with Anne McCarthy, and that was a very nice way to really showcase what&#8217;s coming in a live action, here, this is like a real demo on a real site that I set up. I was using 2023 and I designed it a little bit differently so that it showcased some of the design tooling in the actual demo itself and it was great. We had lots of help, lots of folks really chimed in to make that what it was, and I thought it went pretty well.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: The site was beautiful. If you, dear listeners, haven&#8217;t seen it yet, go, and of course there will be a link in the show notes, but go to the product demo and watch that video. You will learn a lot about 6.2, but also it&#8217;s actually a joy to watch, so that&#8217;s definitely….</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Rich Tabor</em>: Awesome.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: It shows that a designer was preparing for the product, absolutely. As mentioned, there are block editor related dev notes, so what&#8217;s coming, what should developers watch out for? We are not going through all 12 of them, but there, we have a few. First off is the introduction of the Block Inspector tabs, which is a design, an interface change, that your customers or you, if you build sites for others, will need to get used to, because now the settings are in two tabs, one is the settings tab, the other one is the appearance tab. In the developer note, we learn how a custom block can manage that for themselves, where do the settings go or the styles? I know that some custom blocks have their own color picker and if they don&#8217;t do anything, they will find it under settings and not under appearance, for instance, because settings is a default. There&#8217;s a little trick there that&#8217;s in the dev notes how to do that, there&#8217;s a new Group attribute that says either style or settings.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Rich Tabor</em>: Next step, we have shadows that are added to global styles in 6.2. These are shadow presets that are provided within the core theme.json file, but themes can also provide their own shadow presets using, I think it&#8217;s settings, shadow preset. There are four or five provided by core, but they&#8217;re pretty easy to override. In the future, releases will include the shadow control elsewhere. Right now, it&#8217;s only on the button block and that&#8217;s to restart refining it and tightening up the experience first. Some other ideas that are circling are perhaps allowing multiple shadows, so how do you Stack them, perhaps? Of course, the blur, the X and the Y, trying to really hone in on the design of the shadows, as well, but right now, they&#8217;re just preset-based. I think they&#8217;re nice, but they do need a little bit more work before we move them available on more blocks.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: You said that they are now only available for the button block, they are not available in the post editor, only in the Site Editor in the style sidebar, just because of that….</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Rich Tabor</em>: That&#8217;s right.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: &#8230; that you only can do global studies with that. The next one is the introduction of an HTML API, which is, it&#8217;s very developer-oriented, so it&#8217;s highly technical, but it&#8217;s a uniform way that WordPress developers now can travel through parsing a website and changing out tags. That was always prone to rejects and all the other things that was only prone to not always hit the mark and this one is now so much better. People can use it not only for the block editor, but of course, also for their PHP plugin or other apps that they add to the WordPress.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Rich Tabor</em>: That&#8217;s right. The next one here is the sticky position block support was added in 6.2. Right now, it&#8217;s featured on top-level Group blocks, so only the Group blocks that are within the top level of your document, so in the list view, it&#8217;s the first level. It&#8217;s this new prop that right now enables you to set it to sticky and if it&#8217;s set to sticky, even within the editor itself, the actual Group block will stick. Right now, it&#8217;s not open to other blocks because there&#8217;s still some UX considerations around sticky positioning, because it doesn&#8217;t always stick if the surrounding element isn&#8217;t tall enough to allow for sticking, so trying to figure a smart way to communicate that is a very important part of that experience, otherwise you would think it would stick, but it doesn&#8217;t. I think that that&#8217;s something significant to iron out, but that&#8217;s already in the works for, hopefully, the next release of WordPress.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: There&#8217;s a lot of trial and error to do and a lot of people have a different ideas on how is this supposed to work, but I am really looking forward to it. Well, the sticky header, we all know about, but with mobile, you also need to think about a sticky footer, because that&#8217;s where your thumb goes. When you look at a webpage, you are not going to the top, you are going to the bottom, so there are quite some new variations possible. The next one is that a lot of people waited for it and now, here it is, custom CSS in the global styles, that&#8217;s one part, but also you can have custom CSS4 on a block level, so it&#8217;s now here. It&#8217;s a little bit more hidden, so it&#8217;s also in the style sidebar, it&#8217;s not upfront in the left-side menu item like it was for the customizer, but it&#8217;s there and it works and it&#8217;s beautiful.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Rich Tabor</em>: Yes.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: A few people asked me if it would also come to the post editor so you can do it on a single instance of a block, because in the style sheet, you only do it for the block and then it propagates over the full site, but if you just want to do one section in your per&#8230; That&#8217;s not possible, unless you do an additional class name in the advanced section and then go to the standard sheet and put that class name and your styles in there. I have an answer for that person who had the question.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Rich Tabor</em>: Yes. And then the next big one is the minimum height dimension support, and this is a new block support feature added to 6.2 for the Group and I believe the Post Content blocks and it&#8217;s opted in by default. This makes the Group and Post Content blocks perform much like the Cover block, where you can set a minimum height that it would take over in the page. It&#8217;s useful, for example, if you had a footer and some content and you wanted the content to keep the footer down below, so you can set a minimum height of the content using a viewport unit, perhaps, and then that would apply it to where the footer would stay towards the bottom of the page and not be meshed up at the top. It&#8217;s pretty self-explanatory and we already have this in the Cover block, but it starts to extend it out into other blocks.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Wonderful. Excellent. Also, there is not a Card block per se, but there is a component there, but I think with the minimum height, you actually could use that Card block for all kinds of different content there. The Miscellaneous Editor changes in WordPress 6 is that that place where all the little things go in. There are a few little things that are not new features, but they are extending existing features. The first one is the fluid typography now also has a minimum font size in the UI that you can set, I think is it UI? Yeah, I think so. You could always do this for the theme. How you can use it, I read 13,000 words in three days or something like that, forgive me for that. That&#8217;s why in 6.1, there was a minimum, but there was a hard coded minimum and now it&#8217;s you can set this as a theme developer, as well, in the theme.json. Of course, it&#8217;s not in the UI yet, fluid topography is not that yet in the style things, I guess.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Rich Tabor</em>: For another Miscellaneous improvement, we have sizing controls for flex layout children. This means that when you have Container blocks, like the Group block and Row and Stack blocks, you can set a flex-type layout which provides controls for the blocks within those. If your blocks are stacked vertically, then it would be a height control, if they&#8217;re stacked horizontally, it&#8217;s a width control, so it&#8217;s dynamic in that sense. You can set, I believe it&#8217;s fit, fill, and fixed, so that&#8217;s where it either hugs the content, fills the available space, or is a fixed value. This plays into the intrinsic design that we were talking about earlier in starting to add more controls that allow a block to either try to take up only a space as it needs, fill up all the space that is available, or stay within constrained value, so it&#8217;s one of those improvements in that direction.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: The next one is there is a new CSS class attributed to every Heading block, so now you can control the Heading block more granularly for each of the levels, and you can, for instance, say a blue background for all the H1s and a pink one for all the H2s, which is now easily done through the theme.json by adding the other style for the elements. You have style elements, each one, color, background, that would be the latter, and the other one would be styles for blocks and then Heading and then the elements, then each one, and the background, so it&#8217;s quite granular in the controls, that&#8217;s pretty cool.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Rich Tabor</em>: Yeah, I agree. I believe the last one for the Miscellaneous Editor improvements is the ability to edit block style variations from theme.json. This is a new theme.json API that allows existing core block style variations to be styled directly from theme.json. For example, the Image block has a rounded variation, so you could target the rounded variation and set its border width or border radius within theme.json now, which is pretty neat.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: I believe then, was it in 15.3, we also get the UI for it in the style?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Rich Tabor</em>: That&#8217;s right.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Well, we&#8217;ll come to that. But that is our WordPress 6.2 rundown on the developer notes. Of course, there&#8217;s more, look at the Field Guide, the links will be in the show notes, of course.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Gutenberg 15.2 and 15.3</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<p>We&#8217;re coming to the last, to Gutenberg releases 15.2 and 15.3. Gutenberg 15.2 was released on February 23rd. Yes, it&#8217;s been that long that we heard each other, I know, and I&#8217;m really sorry about that. Daisy Olsen was release lead for that and it contained 197 PRs merged by 57 contributors, four of them were new. It was mostly fixing bug fixes, because WordPress 6.2 will contain all the features that came out in 14.2 to 15.1, that&#8217;s the whole range, 10 Gutenberg plugin releases, the features all come into core. But then after the beta release, there are a lot&nbsp; more people testing it, they find bugs, and they are still also finished the last little bit on some of the features, so many things in the Gutenberg 5.2 release or in the bug fix category. The new features probably didn&#8217;t make it into 6.2, but we can tackle each one of them and find out.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Rich Tabor</em>: Yes, I&#8217;ll kick us off here. The first bit here is that there is a new nested level when selecting templates or template parts in the Site Editor, which is an enhancement that right now is a little bit it&#8217;s in a middle ground, where it&#8217;s basically a placeholder state for future contents to go. Some ideas are when you focus in on a template part, we could potentially have the different template parts that you could replace with that one, for example, or even some other different controls, like assigning it a category, having its name present, so it&#8217;s right now, a place to start thinking of what controls we can put there to control that template part.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: The second part I want to point out is there&#8217;s now a modal to choose a start pattern for particular templates. The biggest problem users have is they want to start a new template, but how do they start? Now, theme developers and also plugin developers can actually add patterns to the site that now opens a modal and then can be selected. Also, the selection is a little bit better to view because you have more space to see all the patterns that are available for that. There is also an API in the works that lets you target certain templates with your patterns, but that has not been released yet, that&#8217;s still in the works.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Rich Tabor</em>: This next one here is pretty interesting, it&#8217;s the UI for template revisions. Now, we have a button to open up the revisions for templates and template parts, which is quite powerful because previously, it was very difficult or nearly impossible to find those revisions for your actual template parts. Say you&#8217;re focused in on your header and you changed some of your navigation items and then you changed maybe the background color of your header and then saved it all, but wanted to go back to a different version the next day or so, say it didn&#8217;t really sit well, you can now access those revisions and make those requests to change them back to what it was previously. I think it&#8217;s pretty neat on the template level and again on the template part.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Revisions, I always need to change my mind once back and forth, this revision is really helpful, having access to it to know what my former self was thinking with that and go back to a previous one. The next one with 15.2, it came a global save button to the Site Editor, so when you make changes to multiple templates and all that, it tracks them and then you can save all at once, but it&#8217;s not anymore to the right, it&#8217;s going to be on the left. I think it makes it, actually, in 6.2, you can have that, that was….</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Rich Tabor</em>: Yeah, I believe so. We have another one here for the Post Excerpt block that allows you to control the length of the excerpt. There&#8217;s a range control now where you could slide it left or right, or I think you could also enter an integer value, as well. It would essentially truncate to the Post Excerpt within the Query Loop block, so now you can define how long you want those to be instead of falling back on the default number of characters, which was pretty large, so it&#8217;s a nice quality of life improvement for designing.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: I&#8217;m just hesitating and I need to verify this, there is the possibility that that was actually reversed in a later version.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Rich Tabor</em>: I think the change, it was affecting if a post type didn&#8217;t support Post Excerpts. I don&#8217;t know that it actually reverted the control itself, but it is still a work in progress, that&#8217;s why I don&#8217;t think it landed in 6.2.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: No, it didn&#8217;t.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Rich Tabor</em>: It could be tidied up a little bit.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: We definitely need to test this, as well, in a real-life situation.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Rich Tabor</em>: Yes.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Do you have a site that&#8217;s on Nightly or on trunk, where you have all the latest versions in production or so?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Rich Tabor</em>: Yes. I&#8217;m running it dangerously, I&#8217;m running everything. The whole eat your own dog food stuff, I just really want to see the problems before they get big.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: I changed over, I don&#8217;t know, a year ago for the Gutenberg Times to run on WordPress Nightly and also on the trunk version of the Gutenberg Nightly, which is a plugin coming every day from the current version.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Rich Tabor</em>: That&#8217;s right.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: On the website, on the Gutenberg Times, you can see the Nightly, if you need to live on the edge.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Rich Tabor</em>: Yes.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: The next item on the list is that the Post Featured Image block now has aspect ratio controls, so you can determine that and it makes your post table, the list of posts, much nicer to control that so when you have different sizes and images, you can actually say which aspect ratio you want to have in there. That&#8217;s a long-time want of mine to get that. There are themes who manage that quite well, but now you can do this, as well, in the block editor site templates thing.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Rich Tabor</em>: Yes. There&#8217;s some more follow-ups on aspect ratio. I think it can be quite a powerful tool for not just a Post Featured Image block, but also just Image blocks or even Cover block maybe, I think there&#8217;s other ways to continue to push that forward, for sure.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: I see from my agency days, which are not that long ago, see users adding featured images or even just images when they&#8217;re just changed the size of it and they didn&#8217;t change the aspect ratio with it, it was just very distorted. It&#8217;s very hard to teach that who is not dealing with it on a day-to-day basis and does not have an image dimension feel for it, it&#8217;s very hard to teach that, so if that works out as it should be in the editor, it makes for a much better web.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Bug Fixes</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Rich Tabor</em>: Yes, yes. I think that&#8217;s it for the highlights, for the enhancements. There was a whole slew of bugs that were fixed in 15.2, so I&#8217;ll call out this one here. The ToolsPanel needed a couple of tweaks, there&#8217;s a new feature in 6.2 for copy and pasting styles so you can design a heading or design a button, design anything, and copy its styling and then paste it onto another like block, so copy the heading styles to another heading or button to another button, for example. We needed a way to ensure that those values were properly propagated to these other blocks so there were some minor tweaks to fix that, but now, it&#8217;s all good and when you copy and paste those styles, you see those applied properly within the tools.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: That&#8217;s such a phenomenal feature, that copy styles over, that you can have it. It&#8217;s in-between block-oriented or block on this post and global styles, it&#8217;s in-between, and sometimes you need that to make the same things look the same, but not the other things. It&#8217;s really good to just do copy paste on that. I think that was it for 15.2, unless I&#8217;m overlooking something. I&#8217;m scrolling, scrolling, scrolling. Scrolling, scrolling, scrolling.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Rich Tabor</em>: This is a pretty big Changelog, yes.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Yeah. I find one, though. You could use, so that&#8217;s for the build tools, the WP Scripts has now another flag that you can actually run it in development without having the watch from apply every build on your development system. I think that&#8217;s a good flag to point out for people who use those internal script for that. That&#8217;s the Gutenberg 15.2 for us. Let&#8217;s dive right in to 15.3. You&#8217;re coming right off of releasing it, Rich, so what was your first experience with&#8230; Was this your first experience releasing a Gutenberg plugin?</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Gutenberg 15.3</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Rich Tabor</em>: Yes, it was, but I did co-release it with Hector, so he&#8217;s a team member of mine. He helped me, he guided me quite a bit on this one, but it was pretty smooth, to be honest, especially there&#8217;s a little bit of tension around getting the immediate bug fixes in for 6.2 and backporting and keeping that in line. But generally speaking, I think it&#8217;s a well-oiled machine and moving forward.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Definitely. It&#8217;s the 153rd release, so you hope that everything is well-oiled by then.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Rich Tabor</em>: That&#8217;s right.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: I like when you say backport and not only to 6.2, but also there are bug fixes for the release after the Release Candidate. There is an expression that I really like that&#8217;s cherry picking, which is an interesting thing to do.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Rich Tabor</em>: Yes.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Enhancements</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: But it&#8217;s just a little joke. People talk about it with cherry emojis. The release had 161 PRs in there, so almost as big as 15.2, and also a lot of bug fixes in there, but it also had some enhancements to the Duotone, quite a few. The Duotone CSS is now not created in line, that&#8217;s the expression, right?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Rich Tabor</em>: Yes. It&#8217;s not applied in line.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: In line, it&#8217;s now in the style engine, so it can also be controlled through all the different levels. There is a control for the global size control for the Duotone and CSS variables instead of slugs, which helps it to propagate it over different to use the presets, as well, so Duotone is quite interesting. There is actually a bug in the backwards compatibility, it&#8217;s already noted that when you have a Cover block with Duotone and you upgrade it to 15.3, you get the heart attack kind of thing, oh, my Duotone is missing. If you apply them again on the same Cover block, it will appear again. That&#8217;s something that we found while we were testing it, but the bug fix is in the works.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Rich Tabor</em>: Nice. It also means that by using these slugs instead of hardcoded hex values for colors, that when you do switch to variations, for example, those Duotones can actually map now to the new variations. If they use the same slugs, then you&#8217;ll get the new styles instead of in previous versions, where if you applied a Duotone reset from a theme, like say it was yellow and blue and then you switched to a variation or changed your theme up to one that was green, they would still be yellow and blue, so now it can receive the new ones if there are there. I think it&#8217;s a pretty cool improvement on something that is one of those things that should have always worked this way and now that we&#8217;ve explored a little bit more, it&#8217;s like, &#8220;Let&#8217;s go ahead and knock that out,&#8221; so a lot of effort went into that.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: The style versions are very, very interesting in that regard, that sometimes you want the thing to come over, take over your site, but then you want certain things that stay the same. It&#8217;s very hard to read the user&#8217;s mind as a developer, as a designer.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Rich Tabor</em>: The way I look at it is if you&#8217;re using a preset, then that&#8217;s game for a theme to manipulate. But if you&#8217;ve applied your own colors, I believe in these Duotone PRs, even if you applied a red and black, by picking the actual colors yourself, then those will stay hex value, so when you switch to a different theme, they&#8217;ll still remain red and black. But if it&#8217;s a preset, I would say that it&#8217;s open for interpretation by the theme designer.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: I think there is a bug in there. 15.3 also brings us a new block. It&#8217;s been a while since we had new blocks, but this one is a very tiny block, but it&#8217;s very powerful. People know that in a list view, you can see the number of blocks and the number of words and the time to read and several people asked, &#8220;Can we have that also show up as a block so we can add it to our post template or for the single post?&#8221; Yes, this was now implemented. It&#8217;s a very basic block, it only shows one minute or three minutes, well, 15 minutes, that&#8217;s all it does, but I really like that, because first, it can be translated in any language, and if you use it together with a Paragraph block in a Row, then you can have any string in front of it or after it that you as a site owner want to put in there. I tested that and it worked really nice.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Rich Tabor</em>: I think there&#8217;s some follow-up PRs to do on that to add some of the design tooling that exists on other blocks, but it&#8217;s a great start and just nice, another piece of meta that can help readers know what to expect, investment-wise, like how much time am I going to invest on this? I think it&#8217;s great.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: That was the one point where I really needed and was so happy that they have now, the custom CSS, because on the blog where I used it, I wanted to have that line reading time, one minute or three minute, be smaller than the rest of the excerpt in the post list. I was able to, of course, use the typography controls for the paragraph part, but not for the time to read, so I created, there is an advanced section where I can add a new class. I set a T2R and then went to the custom styles and then created the custom style for the T2R and made it font size small, which is pretty much the same as the reading time. It worked out of the box and with the rows, I could align it. The row controls were really nice, I like that. Now, I see that you could do some of the other shortcuts that are out there that are actually strings that are in a paragraph can now be blocks that need some design controls, but you don&#8217;t have to use the shortcuts anymore.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Rich Tabor</em>: That&#8217;s right.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: I&#8217;m thinking a little bit more in that direction.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Rich Tabor</em>: Yes.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: I know that some of the developers actually were exploring having a token system to take care of those string-related in the middle of a paragraph kind of thing. I&#8217;m not sure if that is needed or just introduces another complication or complexity to the system and it&#8217;s hard for users to use. If you have a block meta for it, it&#8217;s so much easier to get it into the system.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Rich Tabor</em>: Yes, I agree. 15.3, I would say these are the big hitters on these, but there were a bunch of small improvements like making the Site Logo block placeholder just a little bit smaller so it fits better within headers, especially around the new header patterns included in 6.2. There&#8217;s been some quite a few bug fixes around template parts, resetting all for typography, making sure the Site Editor&#8217;s a little bit more tightened up, so some of the alignment parts and then the design units within the Site Editor have been tweaked and it looks and feels like it&#8217;s coming together quite well, but generally, I think those are the big hitters.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Let me go a little bit, I&#8217;m scrolling, scrolling, scrolling. Oh, what also happened, say, for some of the developers there wanted to know if there are new theme.json filters came into 6.1, but they were not yet in the documentation and they are now. There is a page in the how to guides of the Block Editor Handbook that is titled Curating the Editor Experience that has all the different ways how you can control or disable some of the features that are either in the sidebar available for your user or not or show up or are not. Now, you can also do this for the theme.json filters, they are now listed there. I believe one of the writers on the Developer Blog is actually looking at writing about them and having some good examples that are a little bit more closer to the real-life situations. I used the release candidate Changelog, but I think that was it, right, we all done?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Rich Tabor</em>: Yeah, I think so.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Yes. That&#8217;s all we wanted you to know about 15.3, the rest you need to discover yourself. Of course, we have the What&#8217;s New in Gutenberg 15.3 post will be in the show notes. I don&#8217;t know if you published them yet or is it still in the works?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Rich Tabor</em>: It should be out soon, yes.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: I wait for the episode to be published for that post, of course, so we can get it in there. Almost at the end of our Changelog episode, so what&#8217;s next for you in next week or next month?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Rich Tabor</em>: 6.2, the idea is that it sums up the culmination of Phase 2 and the kickoff of Phase 3. It doesn&#8217;t mean that there isn&#8217;t quite a bit more customization and design tooling that we need to continue to bake in, even like I was saying with the time to read block, as well, but that means that there&#8217;s now some more thinking going into what workflow-oriented processes look like for Phase 3, what type of collaboration can we start looking at. Making those plans and start writing about them and sharing ideas with everyone and really getting folks on focus and on point with Phase 3, I think is really important, so I&#8217;m going to start digging into that a little bit more, making sure the about page assets are tightened up and looking good for 6.2, and continuing to explore around designing block themes within the editor.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Awesome. I very much looking forward to the Phase 3 collaboration because it also will catapult your WordPress a little bit ahead of all of the other content management systems, because that&#8217;s what we are actually waiting for the last 25 years, is collaborating on our websites and not using all the other tools where you have to copy paste things over once you&#8217;re done with the collaboration. Now, you can do it all on the website, so I am really excited about that. Thank you so much for being on the show and walking us through all the great design and interface changes. When people want to reach you, where can they reach out?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Rich Tabor</em>: I write and share everything I know on my blog, richtabor, that&#8217;s T-A-B-O-R, .com. I am on Twitter, so Richard, R-I-C-H-A-R-D, _Tabor. I like to explore the fringes of WordPress and experience and try to push ideas around and see what resonates with folks, so feel free to chime in and ask questions or ping me anywhere.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: As always, the show notes will be published on the gutenbergtimes.com/podcast. This is the 80th episode. If you have questions, suggestions, or news you want us to talk about, send them to <a href=\"mailto:changelog@gutenbergtimes.com\">changelog@gutenbergtimes.com</a>.

Phew. The contributors published twelve Dev Notes related to the Block Editor together with the <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/news/2023/03/wordpress-6-2-release-candidate-1/\">Release candidate 1 version</a> of WordPress 6.2. The <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/2023/03/09/wordpress-6-2-field-guide/\"><strong>Field Guide</strong></a> has all the developer related updates. It&#8217;s time for plugin and theme developers to test their products for compatibility with the new WordPress version. The final version is scheduled for March 28th, 2023. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The release squad for documentation, Milana Cap, Abha Thakor, Femy Praseet, and yours truly, wrangled the developer notes from two tracking systems, WordPress Trac and Gutenberg Repo. After the posts were drafted, we took turns reviewing them before publishing, all 13,150 words. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Then there were the posts for the <a href=\"https://developer.wordpress.org/news/\">WordPress Developer Blog</a>, that needed editing and reviewing.

The purpose of the survey was to help those running these instances understand how important Mastodon is for the WordPress community and what they can do to improve their instances to foster a better meeting place.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Key findings from the survey have been <a href=\"https://github.com/danielauener/toot-the-word\">published</a> alongside the <a href=\"https://github.com/danielauener/toot-the-word/blob/main/toot-the-word-survey-2023.raw.csv\">raw data</a> on GitHub for anyone to analyze. More than 82% of respondents (172/209) said they frequently use Mastodon. The community is active and Mastodon is an important social channel for those who have adopted it in addition to their other networks.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>A few other highlights from the published findings include: </p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li>Nearly all participants of the survey expect Mastodon to have some kind of influence on the WordPress community in the future, a majority thinks Mastodon will be very influential or extremely influential. Most of the participants want to see more WordPress content and community discussions on Mastodon in the future.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Generally, users on WordPress-oriented instances state that the communication with the community on Mastodon is important to their WordPress-related social media activity. They also are working with the community, or state that they are WordPress Community influencers, more often than users on common instances.</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p>The survey also found that the respondents who rated themselves as important to the WordPress community seem higher in WordPress-related instances, which may mean that those looking for more relevant WordPress-related content and interactions are better-suited joining these existing instances rather than unrelated ones or creating their own.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;For me as an instance admin, it&#8217;s important to know that all the work I&#8217;m doing means something for the tooters on my instance and the entire community,&#8221; wptoot.social administrator Daniel Auener told the Tavern. &#8220;I think the survey has shown that many in the still small WP/Mastodon community see this network as important as I do. So I&#8217;m quite confident (as many of the surveys participants) that Mastodon will have its place in the WordPress community.&#8221; </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Administrating a Mastodon instance is not trivial. The users depend on the administrator to keep everything up and running with system updates, hosting, community moderation, curating community lists, and other housekeeping tasks. Auener said his current hosting costs are $20-30/month and they are 70-80% covered by <a href=\"https://www.buymeacoffee.com/wptoots\">one-time donations</a> and commitments on Patreon.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;If nothing more, the [survey] results will keep me and my wptoots-instance going,&#8221; Auener said. &#8220;I even hope that the results will show others within the community that Mastodon as a social network is worth supporting and finding their own ways to contribute.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Auener hasn&#8217;t planned anything specific yet but based on the results it is clear that participants want to have more WordPress content in their timelines. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;I think one of the best ways of achieving that would be to onboard more WordPress sites to the fediverse via ActivityPub,&#8221; he said. &#8220;Working in that direction is something I&#8217;m thinking about.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>There is an <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/activitypub/\">ActivityPub</a> plugin for WordPress that implements the ActivityPub protocol for so that readers can follow your site&#8217;s posts on Mastodon and other federated platforms that support ActivityPub. It is currently used by more than 2,000 WordPress sites and is one avenue for users to automate sharing their content  across the fediverse. A search for Mastodon plugins turns up <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/search/mastodon/\">several other auto sharing plugins</a> and Jetpack is also considering <a href=\"https://github.com/Automattic/jetpack/issues/7790\">adding Mastodon support to Publicize</a> after many requests on a ticket opened in 2017.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Some Mastodon users on other instances have considered switching to a WordPress-oriented instance, so increasing education for users on how to move to a new instance is another improvement Auener is considering.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;The data even seems to support that the quality of (WordPress-)conversation is better on our instances,&#8221; he said. &#8220;So spreading that information, helping people to move and keeping our instances a safe space for great WordPress discussions is another cause for action.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Joining Mastodon&#8217;s federated network is still intimidating for some who are not familiar with how the instances work and are not sure which one to join. Others fear they may lose out on interactions and connections by moving to a lesser-used social network. This survey indicates that the WordPress-related instances are active and important to the community interacting there. Auener has created a document called <a href=\"https://www.danielauener.com/the-wordpressers-guide-to-the-fediverse/\">The WordPressers Guide to the Fediverse</a> for those who are new and want to learn more.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;I would like to align my work more with the WordPress community and the work all the amazing people in the community teams and initiatives do,&#8221; he said. &#8220;I&#8217;m quite new in the game and think I can learn a lot from people working within the community for years. I think Mastodon/the Fediverse aligns very well with WordPress values but there is still a lot of convincing to do.&#8221;</p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Fri, 10 Mar 2023 22:43:55 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"Sarah Gooding\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:39;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:63:\"Post Status: Launching a WordPress Product in Public: Session 4\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:32:\"https://poststatus.com/?p=148107\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:73:\"https://poststatus.com/launching-a-wordpress-product-in-public-session-4/\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:94416:\"<div class=\"is-layout-flow wp-block-group eplus-wrapper has-theme-palette-2-color has-theme-palette-8-background-color has-text-color has-background\"><div class=\"wp-block-group__inner-container\"><div class=\"wp-block-post-excerpt\"><p class=\"wp-block-post-excerpt__excerpt\"><a href=\"https://twitter.com/coreymaass\">Corey Maass</a> and <a href=\"https://twitter.com/corymiller303\">Cory Miller</a> continue laying the groundwork for the launch of their new plugin <a href=\"https://crop.express/#welcome\">Crop.Express</a>.

They discuss building launch assets, utilizing a freemium model as a path toward a premium product, and future possibilities.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Top Takeaways:</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Value of a Soft Launch</strong>. This is a great way to test the waters and get initial feedback. If you utilize a soft launch, you need to be willing to make changes and improvements based on that feedback before you fully launch.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Building a Sustainable Premium Product.</strong> Start by setting up a basic website and integration to attract customers. Establishing a freemium model allows you to identify what users will value enough to pay for and provides space for your plugin to become a recommended tool for users, agencies, and hosting providers as a premium product.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Feedback as Fuel</strong>. Gathering input from customers and agency owners in the WordPress ecosystem can help you understand the barriers to adoption, like already established workflows, the challenge of installing and learning a new tool, and limitations within initial versions to full adoption.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Importance of Image Use.</strong> Current workflows make images an afterthought in content creation, but they are critical to drawing interest, provide context, and evoke emotion. While there may be SEO value, the primary purpose is to appeal to human visitors. Creating tools to make this easier is the case for Crop.Express.&nbsp;</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Consider the possibilities.</strong> As product creators, you should continue to explore potential opportunities for development. Leveraging AI, increasing user engagement, and offering more value can uncover future revenue streams while you focus on current integration points.</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\">\n\n</div>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"eplus-wrapper\" id=\"h-mentioned-in-the-show\"><img src=\"https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/14.0.0/72x72/1f517.png\" alt=\"🔗\" class=\"wp-smiley\" /> Mentioned in the show:</h3>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://crop.express/\">Crop.Express</a></li>\n\n\n\n<li><a href=\"https://www.canva.com/\">Canva</a></li>\n\n\n\n<li><a href=\"https://www.adobe.com/products/photoshop.html\">Photoshop</a></li>\n\n\n\n<li><a href=\"https://www.stockunlimited.com/\">Stock Unlimited</a></li>\n\n\n\n<li><a href=\"https://unsplash.com/\">Unsplash</a></li>\n\n\n\n<li><a href=\"https://contentjourney.com/\">Content Journey</a></li>\n\n\n\n<li><a href=\"https://news.ycombinator.com/\">Hacker News</a></li>\n\n\n\n<li><a href=\"https://www.wpbeaverbuilder.com/\">Beaver Builder</a></li>\n\n\n\n<li><a href=\"https://twitter.com/pmgarman\">Patrick Garman</a></li>\n\n\n\n<li><a href=\"https://twitter.com/hluehrsen\">Hendrick Luehrsen</a></li>\n\n\n\n<li><a href=\"https://elementor.com/%5C\">Elementor</a></li>\n\n\n\n<li><a href=\"https://twitter.com/renewabelle\">Jess Frick</a></li>\n\n\n\n<li><a href=\"https://pressable.com/\">Pressable</a></li>\n\n\n\n<li><a href=\"https://www.kadencewp.com/\">Kadence</a></li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"eplus-wrapper\" id=\"h-you-can-follow-post-status-and-our-guests-on-twitter\"><img src=\"https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/14.0.0/72x72/1f426.png\" alt=\"🐦\" class=\"wp-smiley\" /> You can follow Post Status and our guests on Twitter:</h3>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"eplus-wrapper\">\n<li><a href=\"http://twitter.com/coreymaass\">Corey Maass</a></li>\n\n\n\n<li><a href=\"https://twitter.com/corymiller303\">Cory Miller</a> (CEO, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/post_status\">Post Status</a>)</li>\n\n\n\n<li><a href=\"https://twitter.com/lemonadecode\">Olivia Bisset</a> (Intern, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/post_status\">Post Status</a>)</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"eplus-wrapper has-background\">The <strong>Post Status Draft</strong> podcast is geared toward WordPress professionals, with interviews, news, and deep analysis. <img src=\"https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/14.0.0/72x72/1f4dd.png\" alt=\"📝\" class=\"wp-smiley\" /><br /><br /><a href=\"https://poststatus.com/category/post-status-podcasts/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Browse our archives</a>, and don’t forget to subscribe via <a href=\"https://itunes.apple.com/us/podcast/post-status-draft-wordpress/id976403008\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">iTunes</a>, <a href=\"https://podcasts.google.com/feed/aHR0cHM6Ly9mZWVkcy5zaW1wbGVjYXN0LmNvbS8ySkU5c2M4UA\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Google Podcasts</a>, <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/c/PostStatus\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">YouTube</a>, <a href=\"http://www.stitcher.com/podcast/krogsgard/post-status-draft-wordpress-podcast\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Stitcher</a>, <a href=\"https://wordpress-post-status-draft-podcast.simplecast.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Simplecast</a>, or <a href=\"https://feeds.simplecast.com/2JE9sc8P\">RSS</a>. <img src=\"https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/14.0.0/72x72/1f3a7.png\" alt=\"🎧\" class=\"wp-smiley\" /></p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"eplus-wrapper\" id=\"h-transcript\">Transcript</h2>\n\n\n\n<h2>Session 4 Corey &amp; Cory Launch a WordPress Product Live</h2>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Corey Maass:</strong> [00:00:00] Uh, host status YouTube channel so we can hopefully period when that pops up. Oh, I&#8217;m signed into the wrong account, but yeah. Um, cuz it seems like people were commenting there. So session four live,  </p>\n\n\n\n<p>we&#8217;re streaming, hopping out the chat because if people are asking us questions and stuff, I&#8217;d love to know about it and interact with it.  </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Okay. We&#8217;re live. Cool. YouTube, baby. All&nbsp;  </p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Cory Miller:</strong> right, let&#8217;s get it. You ready?&nbsp;  </p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Corey Maass:</strong> Internet.&nbsp;  </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Internet.&nbsp;  </p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Cory Miller:</strong> Famous. That&#8217;ll get us maybe a coffee, right?  </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Hey everybody, welcome back to session four. [00:01:00] Corey and Corey launching a WordPress product in public. Today we&#8217;re gonna be talking about some website tweak continuing on from last week, and some feature discussion that the other Corey&#8217;s been working on. Um, and we&#8217;re&nbsp;  </p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Corey Maass:</strong> live, Corey, we are Awesome. Session four.  </p>\n\n\n\n<p>So that&#8217;s, that Marks four weeks. Um, and two what, two weeks or a week since, uh, the plugin was accepted. Um, and we should go look at, uh, let&#8217;s see, word press. I&#8217;m looking at the plugin. In the repo, it still says fewer than 10. So, you know, the harsh reality right, is, is you launch something and you get really excited and you tell your friends about it, um, and the, the repo, and you go and, uh, or.  </p>\n\n\n\n<p>One, not necessarily [00:02:00] me, goes and installs it on as many websites as I own, which is a lot trying to make, you know, total, um, what do they call vanity metrics to make it look like we&#8217;re installed on a bunch of websites. Um, but the, you know, the plug-in repo only gives you fewer than 10, and then groups of 10, and then a hundred groups of hundred.  </p>\n\n\n\n<p>So you never really know how many installs you have.&nbsp;  </p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Cory Miller:</strong> I think this is the moment, uh, when you push your art or your work into the light of day in public and you&#8217;re like, the tendency is to go, oh man, I thought a million people were gonna activate this. I think we&#8217;ve been really reasonable and practical about it, but I just know from my past is you, you get so excited, you think you&#8217;re on the right path.  </p>\n\n\n\n<p>You&#8217;d launch it and you&#8217;re like, Crickets. Cool. Crickets are trippy. Right? Um, [00:03:00] man, that&#8217;s happened so many times and you know, the typical marketing thing is to go, okay, build up buzz to a launch. You know? And we were like, we did it . Here it is . And I, I, I don&#8217;t know how you feel, but I personally would rather launch something than build.  </p>\n\n\n\n<p>I, I know it&#8217;s probably better from a marketing perspective to build up to a launch to use things like product launch formula and stuff like that to like create a compelling story and I&#8217;m just like, or you could push publish. Right. You know, and I think we&#8217;ve had reasonable expectations about it. Not that it would hit a million, you know, active installs or anything like that.  </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Um, but this is the point where I tend to probably have that little moment of deflation. Mm-hmm. . Um, but I&#8217;m not, I&#8217;m, I&#8217;m, I&#8217;m shoving past that. I&#8217;m like, you know, because we, we didn&#8217;t have a big email list to send it to. We&#8217;ve been [00:04:00] putting in post status in our personal channels. Um, but we talked about last week, like key thing was like feedback from people.  </p>\n\n\n\n<p>And so I knew on my list was to talk to content journey about this. Um, because they do so much content production, those people in the use case, the avatar that like does it all the time. Um, but to me, Corey, I&#8217;m curious, your, your perspective on all this too haven&#8217;t launched so many products is there&#8217;s, you, you wait for that cataly moment where you go, we got something.  </p>\n\n\n\n<p>You know, you and I feel had that together. Cause we&#8217;re like, I want this, you know, but now we&#8217;re building to some unknown moment where it&#8217;s like, okay, we got something. Well, and it&#8217;s,&nbsp;  </p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Corey Maass:</strong> yeah, it&#8217;s getting something out there. I, I view where we&#8217;re at. I, I. Have done it dozens of times and I view it as a soft launch.  </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Right? So it&#8217;s, uh, we put it out there. Um, [00:05:00] and frankly I&#8217;d rather it build slowly and then, uh, at some point we are going to have, you know, we we&#8217;re technically at version 0 0 1. Um, and so at some point we&#8217;re gonna launch. Zero one or one . And that&#8217;s when we, in my mind, you know, marketing actually starts, or we put effort into it, or when we start, when we&#8217;ve got, um, something for sale.  </p>\n\n\n\n<p>You know, that&#8217;s when we start putting effort into okay, getting it out there. But to me, this is, this is the soft launch. We want a few people to wander into our restaurant, hopefully, at least some of them are friendly faces and they&#8217;re the ones that are gonna be like, um, you don&#8217;t have any knives, which has actually happened to me over the weekend.  </p>\n\n\n\n<p>We went to a soft launch of a new restaurant and they literally didn&#8217;t have knives. And so I, we were eating chicken and waffles with plastic forks, and so you had to stab the whole chicken breast and like, [00:06:00] take a bite and then put it back down on your plate, you know, but it&#8217;s like great work out the kinks.  </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Um, the, the thing I struggle with honestly is getting, That there&#8217;s times when I build a product that I immediately start using. And, and so to me now the, the difference of a soft launch is, is just building something for me to use it. Um, and here I&#8217;m not yet comfortable, and this is something I&#8217;ve been sort of asking myself about.  </p>\n\n\n\n<p>It&#8217;s like I&#8217;m using it on a couple of my own websites, but I&#8217;m not yet putting it in front of my clients other than showing it to them. But I haven&#8217;t like, installed it and told them, this is what you&#8217;re now using. And so I&#8217;m still looking at the UI and, and going, okay, why, what, what features are lacking?  </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Um, or you know, why don&#8217;t I have confidence in [00:07:00] the, we&#8217;ve, to me, we&#8217;ve technically proven that we can solve the problem, but it&#8217;s not. Elegant enough or friendly enough or simple enough for non-technical people to use. Um, so that&#8217;s kind of where I&#8217;m at. And so I, to me, I feel like we&#8217;re waiting for feedback from all quarters, um, including our own, before taking more steps forward with the actual&nbsp;  </p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Cory Miller:</strong> product.  </p>\n\n\n\n<p>So that&#8217;s an interesting thing, uh, that you said right there is, um, because I went, obviously installed it, used the live version on my site, and, um, immediately I was like, I need, I still need this. I&#8217;m not, I know I need it for featured image, you know, but I ne I feel like just from a user perspective, I go, I need this for other [00:08:00] things on my site.  </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Like mm-hmm. , I was doing a page on my personal site and I was like, And this comes back to our original conversation, um, being able to crop things appropriately in WordPress. I already bump up to my bet still on this cuz I, I want it as the custom specifications. Um, I found myself, I think I used, you know, the circle thing you did?  </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Yep. Uh, the circle crop. I was like, I needed it for something. It wasn&#8217;t a blog post. So, you know, there&#8217;s this perspective of like, I, I know you&#8217;ve been, this flows into our conversation about feature product features and stuff you&#8217;ve been exploring with the media library. I was like, okay, I need a place that I can just like get my images cropped with the size and, um, you know, DPI or whatever, uh, for these things.  </p>\n\n\n\n<p>And I&#8217;m like, this would [00:09:00] be cool to have. I actually use crop.express. I think yesterday for something, right. And I was like, the utility of it. Mm-hmm. still rings true for me. I just need this utility. But I was like, you know what I need, I just need to crop something real quick. I went to crop.express Yep.  </p>\n\n\n\n<p>And used the live, the online tool. Yep. Uh, for it. So I&#8217;m curious your thoughts too about, okay, so when you&#8217;re doing a WordPress website, you&#8217;re, you&#8217;re publishing, you&#8217;re, you&#8217;re creating content and stuff, and it brings back like just an exploration, I&#8217;m not saying we do this, but like your thoughts on media library in the center of, okay.  </p>\n\n\n\n<p>I&#8217;ve created, I, I&#8217;ve loaded my photo, this whole hassle of doing all this, finding photos, cropping photos, all that stuff. And. The utility of like being able to manipulate this and any, any updated thoughts. And maybe we just go straight into the product stuff you&#8217;ve been thinking about.&nbsp;  </p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Corey Maass:</strong> But yeah, I, that&#8217;s, that&#8217;s the [00:10:00] segue.  </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Um, cuz I personally also had a couple of images to crop and was like, okay, I can create a post. I can for the, for the sake of the exercise, I&#8217;ll create a post, I&#8217;ll crop the image and then I&#8217;ll delete the post. And that cropped image is now in my media library. So to me the next, uh, short, short circuit sounds bad, but the next shortcut, there we go.  </p>\n\n\n\n<p>That&#8217;s the good version is I go directly to media library and can manipulate an image. Um, and so I started working on that, um, as kind of the next step cuz it&#8217;s it without hearing, um, again, The having without having too many of these kinds of conversations. I&#8217;m like, okay, well I&#8217;m gonna continue to solve the problem that I have because again, this, you know, the assumption is presumption is that you and I have this, have a problem that a lot of other people have.  </p>\n\n\n\n<p>So, [00:11:00] uh, so featured image, uh, and then the same functionality in ui, uh, on top of the media library, which is coming along pretty well. Um, and then, uh, I actually have classic editor installed. Um, something that I think is gonna come up, uh, pretty often in, in our conversations is that I am, uh, I, I do not go near the block editor.  </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Um, and, uh, for a number of reasons and that&#8217;s its own conversation. But, and, and that isn&#8217;t to say that we don&#8217;t have plans, um, and even some code already for. A block that also allows you to crop images. Um, but, you know, for my own uses, I&#8217;m gonna, IM implement this into the classic editor before I implement this into the block editor.  </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Unless people start telling me like, oh my God, we [00:12:00] need this in the block editor. Um, and again, not to say that that&#8217;s not like next on the list or, you know, within the next few items, but, um, but anyway, so that&#8217;s, you know, to me that&#8217;s, I, I&#8217;m with you. Um, and I think I had, I had also pinged you and, and earlier in the week and said to sort of start the conversation of like, what does, or maybe it was last week, but anyway, like, you know, what, what does the new website look like and how do we implement those same functional, that same functionality?  </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Because also, The plugin now has the circle option and crop.express. The website does not. Um, and so as I&#8217;m getting more and more comfortable, essentially repeating the functionality and the ui, um, you know, we wanna decide on what that lead magnet crop.express as a wide open, pure web utility for cropping images [00:13:00] as, as lead magnet.  </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Like what does that look like? So,  </p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Cory Miller:</strong> yeah, I, utility of it is I love utility tools, you know, um, yeah. And the, the question I wrote down here, will, will, is I think we&#8217;re trying to answer is what will enough people value to pay for. In, in the sustainable premium product type category. And again, just anchoring back to finding the past. And so it&#8217;s like if you&#8217;re creating content online, um, professionally, you, you probably have this utility somewhere like mm-hmm.  </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Camba or Photoshop or whatever that, you know, you affinity designer. And then anchoring to WordPress is content [00:14:00] producers, I think. Mm-hmm. generally speaking. Um, so, and then we&#8217;ve got these two things. We&#8217;ve almost got two potential use cases that you started this project through the online tool. Now we have a plugin and probably, I don&#8217;t know, do you think we need to talk about those two things too?  </p>\n\n\n\n<p>How we keep, uh, like do we keep parody with online tool? Tool and the plugin kind&nbsp;  </p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Corey Maass:</strong> of thing, or I think we start with it anyway. Um, and, and I think that that gives us the sooner the, so to me, yes, like the down the road is the pro version, what are people gonna pay for? Um, but if we are walking the steps of setting ourselves up for freemium, then we need, we just need users full stop, right?  </p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:15:00] And it&#8217;s like, wait, what can we, what&#8217;s the first thing we can start talking about? And normally that&#8217;s the plugin. And so I&#8217;m in forums or I&#8217;m, you know, in Facebook groups or whatever, and I&#8217;m, I&#8217;m mentioning it. Um, and again, I think we&#8217;ll start to see a trickle of users. WordPress, just na natural discovering.  </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Discovery within the WordPress, um, plugin directory. But if, if we are happy with the UI that I&#8217;ve knocked together, then moving that, setting that up, uh, on Crop Express and then, um, and putting a little banner that even links to the free plugin. Need this for WordPress, you know, click here. Um, again, we&#8217;ve already got way beyond the WordPress world.  </p>\n\n\n\n<p>We&#8217;ve got, uh, you know, there&#8217;s so many websites that just let you list that love to list free utility tools. Um, and so to me that&#8217;s, that&#8217;s [00:16:00] an, an easy way to. Have something to talk about even beyond, you know, again, my normal situation is I create a free version of a plugin and then I have to go try to talk, you know, show that to people.  </p>\n\n\n\n<p>And inevitably, lots of the people who see me plugging it are going, well, I don&#8217;t use WordPress, so it&#8217;s not even the beginning of a conversation. So here we&#8217;ve got an extra advantage, you know, I think we could take advantage of that.&nbsp;  </p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Cory Miller:</strong> Yeah, absolutely. Since it&#8217;s already built, like we talked about last week, it&#8217;s a, if anything, it&#8217;s a great lead magnet.  </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Yeah.  </p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Corey Maass:</strong> Okay. So, I mean, I guess what I&#8217;m picturing, you know, is, um, like we, we&#8217;ve started sort of what I put on your to-do list last week is, you know, the, the envisioning of this over time. Um, but I guess I&#8217;m picturing even in the short term, like a landing page and. And [00:17:00] then I can, and then again, I can integrate the, the cropping tool, utility tool, um, and keep chipping away at the plugin essentially.  </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Um, but that gives us lots to talk about, lots to promote. Um, and again, lots of, lots of different, hopefully different places to start collecting feedback because yes, we launched. It&#8217;s fun. Um, but like you said, then there&#8217;s that little like, okay, now what? And, and then, and then it&#8217;s the feedback. It can be internal feedback, but we, we need some guidance on what we do next.  </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Mm-hmm.&nbsp;  </p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Cory Miller:</strong> swag. S always swag. Come on, . I mean, you created the new logo.&nbsp;  </p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Corey Maass:</strong> Oh, that&#8217;s right. So yeah. On, you know, uh, as far as accountability goes, I think&nbsp;  </p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Cory Miller:</strong> you had more fun. Did the logo than the plugin, by the way?&nbsp;  </p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Corey Maass:</strong> Oh, always, always. Yeah. No, it&#8217;s, I, there was a [00:18:00] time, uh, that I fancied myself a designer and I missed that.  </p>\n\n\n\n<p>And once Design switched, and this is me dating myself, but once Design switched from Photoshop to, um, technically Illustrator, but I still actually use, I used the fla, I used Flash, and now I actually still use Animate, which is the, the modern version of, but I just like their vector designer. Easier, better.  </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Um, I also design a lot of logos now in Canva. Same thing, like I love the simplicity, I love the constraints of it. And so it&#8217;s just you, you take away and take away and take away. And you saw me do that. Like I was sending you comps where it was not necessarily complicated, but there was a lot more lines.  </p>\n\n\n\n<p>And then the moment where I was like, that&#8217;s, it was when I deleted most of the lines and it was like, oh, the essence of what I&#8217;ve been trying to accomplish is there. Um, but yeah, I, I, I love, I [00:19:00] mean the books behind me here, the books next to me are, uh, you know, are bowhouse, uh, graphic design, like, nice. I don&#8217;t, I don&#8217;t, I don&#8217;t have code books next to me,  </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Everything I have next to me is, is architecture or graphic design or, you know, some sort of&nbsp;  </p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Cory Miller:</strong> visual. Okay. So  </p>\n\n\n\n<p>this is what makes product stuff fun, um, and engaging. So I&#8217;m anchoring back. Um,  </p>\n\n\n\n<p>we need, I, I think we, we&#8217;ve talked about this a lot and it&#8217;s like, we need someone to give us feedback. And so that&#8217;s where it was talked to. Content journey.  </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Another thought here [00:20:00] is  </p>\n\n\n\n<p>asking agency owners mm-hmm. people that build sites and getting there, because I, I, we&#8217;ve talked about this a lot. I, we think agency owners in the, in the WordPress ecosystem essentially, um, end up. This is my perspective, but I want to hear yours. Buying plugins, functionality, things like that for their client&#8217;s websites, whether they use their key, their premium key, or whatever it is.  </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Um, and that&#8217;s a whole separate issue. But I&#8217;ve tended to see, you know, we want to do this, uh, we need this for, the client will buy it. Whether we pass it on the client, we just absorb it. You know, the gravity forms, ws any kind of form plugin, I bet you is on like 90% of client websites for the agency going, you need forms, you&#8217;ve gotta have forms.  </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Um, and it seems to me it&#8217;s like if we fit [00:21:00] this in the story agency owner, freelancer builder, person delivering a site for a client where I&#8217;ve seen the most. Use cases just from my themes and different things, is like they&#8217;re gonna use their website or it&#8217;s a, like a content production agency like content journey or whatever else.  </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Or a blogger, professional blogger, creator using this to speed up workflow now. Mm-hmm. , how does that sit with you? Like, we&#8217;ve kind of, I feel like we&#8217;ve defined this case of like, if you&#8217;re producing content on a regular basis, this could be a tool in your utility, in your workflow. How does that square, and what are your thoughts here about like, I like talking to agency owners because then they might, might be the number one customer binded on behalf of their clients so they don&#8217;t have crappy, you know, huge 15 megabyte files on their site.  </p>\n\n\n\n<p>I don&#8217;t know what, what are your thoughts there? Because I, and, [00:22:00] and sometimes I go really slow on this and ask questions because I&#8217;m trying to get it, when it gets clear in my mind what we see, it&#8217;ll help. I think it really helps me personally to go here, you know? What are your thoughts on that?&nbsp;  </p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Corey Maass:</strong> Yeah, I think, I think that that&#8217;s fine.  </p>\n\n\n\n<p>We, I just, I guess I&#8217;m not clear on how we do that, right? Like we are, I, I guess what I&#8217;m finding in, in me taking the leap forward in implementing this into the media library is that we&#8217;re not, not quite, like we&#8217;ve got the, I don&#8217;t know, the cardboard version or something. Um, and so it&#8217;s like, I don&#8217;t, I don&#8217;t actually anticipate.  </p>\n\n\n\n<p>One of the things I also realized was if, uh, If you, if you have already have the perfect image, like one of the, okay, [00:23:00] so sorry I&#8217;m a little all over the place. I didn&#8217;t sleep well, so I&#8217;m not as coherent as I&#8217;d like to be, but bear with me. Um, if, sorry. One of the most difficult things in what we&#8217;re trying to do, what anybody is trying to do product-wise is unless you have a brand new thing, um, you are, you&#8217;re walking into or you&#8217;re trying to get people to switch.  </p>\n\n\n\n<p>So like you said, people already have a process for editing, editing images, they&#8217;re already in Canva. So how do we get them to. Take an afternoon, you know, and install the plugin and say, okay, for this next post, instead of using Canva, I&#8217;m going to use this plugin. Um, and, and so that&#8217;s, that&#8217;s tricky, right?  </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Because we also only have one opportunity to get it right, right now. I mean, people will try again, at least a free version. Um, but I feel like [00:24:00] we&#8217;re, we&#8217;re, we&#8217;re still a little shy of solving the problem enough so that people are gonna keep it installed. Like one of the things again that I realize that isn&#8217;t there is if you already have the perfect image, we force you to crop it  </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Um, and we also, uh, like we&#8217;ve talked about, we don&#8217;t have, uh, we&#8217;re, you know, we&#8217;ve, we&#8217;ve put in a handful of Square 16, nine. Four three. Um, there isn&#8217;t a way to customize that, and we&#8217;re talking about charging for that down the road, which is fine. But again, right now, are there gonna be enough people that are coming in and going, you know, I only need one of these five and that&#8217;s sufficient.  </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Um mm-hmm. , I&#8217;ll keep this installed. Um, and then again, for me it was like, oh, but I could go over to Media Library and upload any old [00:25:00] image. So it&#8217;s like we, we&#8217;ve, we, we have a proof of concept, which I think is great, but I, I also wonder that we&#8217;re not a little premature in calling it a product yet. Right.  </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Um, or, or how do we, mm. How do we get people to install this and it might, and, and leave it installed or, you know, promise to come back in a month and try it again, or like, I don&#8217;t think we&#8217;re, we&#8217;re not hurting ourselves by having it in the repo. It gives us something to talk about, gives something, you know, a place to link, all that kind of stuff.  </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Um, But now, I guess, you know, getting, going all the way back to one of your first questions, uh, or the first things that I talked about on this call was, um, where I&#8217;m at is usually I, this is where I start scrambling to be like, oh, you know, now that I&#8217;m public, oh crap. Like people are seeing that the wheels are on my go-kart or square and I need to quick chisel them to [00:26:00] be C circles or they&#8217;re gonna make fun of me kind of thing.  </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Um, and so it&#8217;s, you know, there there&#8217;s a little bit of a, like, what, what do we, you know, what is the next thing that we have to do to get people to actually keep trying this, um, or stick with this or, or what have you.&nbsp;  </p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Cory Miller:</strong> Okay. I wanna go back to a couple things. You said, this is a powerful statement. You said keep it installed, okay.  </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Mm-hmm. , I love that because it centers us sneakers us down in, like, we&#8217;re a utility workflow at Flow tool. And the question becomes how do we. Keep it installed. How do we, what do we do to keep it installed? And then we have this other fine line of like, there&#8217;s a breaking point. We go, that&#8217;s paid. This is free, that&#8217;s paid, you know, particularly with the free right.  </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Um, so Hendrix has given us some interesting thing, and if you will, I want to explore this for a second because you&#8217;re on the media library. So Hendrick [00:27:00] said media. We&#8217;re talking to an agency owner right now. It&#8217;s awesome. Thanks. Hendrick. Media management. The media library is crap, easily leads to the same images being uploaded multiple times, identifying problems, what we&#8217;re doing.  </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Um, we&#8217;re chasing that problem a little bit. Editing is another issue. This results in other stuff. For content, Leon is subtly necessary again. So if I talk about, it&#8217;s interesting maybe your client thing. How, how do you, your, your newspapers and magazines that you work with, what&#8217;s their flow? And this is the thing I need to just ask.  </p>\n\n\n\n<p>From Content Journey two on my side, and I didn&#8217;t do that. Apologies. Um, Hendricks is helping, but like, what&#8217;s their content workflow? Do they, like I know Content Journey starts in Google Docs. Mm. And does a lot of their collaboration. Uh, then they put it in here and then there&#8217;s image like from in Hendricks, he&#8217;s like, media.  </p>\n\n\n\n<p>We, we know this media library has needed something in [00:28:00] WordPress for a long time. So I think we stumbled into a really good problem here. Um, but like, what&#8217;s the workflow? You know, like me, I go, I start writing headline, start into text. The last thing I do is the image, but I take it professionals have a different way to do that.  </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Like, I, I guess I do this semi my professionally, but like , you know, that&#8217;s the&nbsp;  </p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Corey Maass:</strong> people. It&#8217;s not your job title.&nbsp;  </p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Cory Miller:</strong> Yeah. . Um, that&#8217;s the people that use it as a workflow tool. And I think you, you mentioned something else, the switch. Mm-hmm. . The switch from co. I think it&#8217;s really cool cuz we got cobble these together over here and then put it in a WordPress and published, but we&#8217;re trying to say, we&#8217;d like to make that better within WordPress.  </p>\n\n\n\n<p>What I don&#8217;t know for sure I&#8217;m unsure of is how most professional content people do this. Mm-hmm. , you know, do they go [00:29:00] checklist beforehand? Image title, like, I know Content Journey has a whole SEO and content stuff and process they work through. Right. Thoughts on that?&nbsp;  </p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Corey Maass:</strong> About the media library? The, the, the clients I, I have do not use the client, the media library they are uploading, um, on one site.  </p>\n\n\n\n<p>It&#8217;s.  </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Cu it&#8217;s a custom size and a 16 nine, and then on the other site it&#8217;s square and 16 nine. There&#8217;s, I, I had to add essentially multiple featured images for each story. So it&#8217;s like on the homepages and on the archive pages, we show squares, and then when you click through to see the individual post, you see the, the big 16 nine.  </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Um, but exactly as, and I&#8217;m, I have the same question mark as you, like, this [00:30:00] is where they&#8217;ve arrived. But these are, and these are professional writers, but they are not experienced WordPress people for the most part. So this is the flow that they&#8217;ve settled in on. Um, but yes, content comes from Google Docs.  </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Same thing that I&#8217;m, I&#8217;ve seen almost everywhere that I&#8217;ve worked where there&#8217;s a lot of content. So I think that that&#8217;s very, I think that&#8217;s the most common situation. Um, and then, and images are last is also the thing that I have also seen with both, with the, the, the number of sites that I work with now and have worked with in the past, even at big, big agencies on, on sites bigger than, than what I work on now.  </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Images come last, they go and hunt for somebody goes and hunts for an image after the content is written. Um, and like I said, what I&#8217;ve got, I mean, this was why I created [00:31:00] crop.express as a utility in the first place, was I, I said this, they can&#8217;t just keep uploading. These are, these are writers, they&#8217;re non-technical people.  </p>\n\n\n\n<p>And so it&#8217;s, there&#8217;s the shame on them, shame on me situation where. I&#8217;ve tried to teach them, or I, you know, and created documentation and stuff like that around proper crop image cropping and image compression and all that stuff. But at some point I have to say, okay, you know, I&#8217;m, I&#8217;m the technologist here.  </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Technology needs to do this for them. And so that&#8217;s where, yeah, I, I think we&#8217;re on the right path featured. I, and that&#8217;s why when you initially suggested, let&#8217;s start with featured image, I jumped, I was like, yes, that&#8217;s it. Um, see,&nbsp;  </p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Cory Miller:</strong> you pointed that out to me though. I want you to know this. Hmm. For context, because you&#8217;re in work doing [00:32:00] client work.  </p>\n\n\n\n<p>I know what a featured image is. , you have clients using that? We use it at post status and I don&#8217;t like it. Like mm-hmm. , the featured image the way that, or I haven&#8217;t taken the time to take the theme, so like, blown out. Huge PI pictures down. I haven&#8217;t taken the time to dive into it, but you&#8217;re like, most every theme includes featured image functionality, so there&#8217;s step one, you know?  </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Yeah. I wanna zoom out for a second, Corey, if you, if you&#8217;re okay with this, we&#8217;ll get, we&#8217;ll get back to the product, but this will help me, this discussion. Yeah, sure. Images in publishing, what&#8217;s their purpose, what&#8217;s their reason? What are the people trying to get out of them? The two things I stand out to me is something to hang your eyes on.  </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Mm-hmm. . Something to set the tone of the content you&#8217;re writing. That&#8217;s one. Second to me is like SEO value. You know, put an image in here of. Someone [00:33:00] doing or showing the thing you&#8217;re talking about. So there&#8217;s a, there&#8217;s an SEO angle to it. Those are my two tops. But can, I&#8217;m, I&#8217;m doing this on the mind map by the way, cuz I want us to get this story.  </p>\n\n\n\n<p>This is the narrative to me. Sure. But like, if we zoom out, we just go like, what&#8217;s the purpose of an&nbsp;  </p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Corey Maass:</strong> image? Yeah. I mean the, the, I&#8217;ve got paper magazines behind me, um, which is what one of the main sites that I work on. And in a magazine you can&#8217;t not have a picture. And so it, it translates to the web where, you know, we&#8217;ve nerds like me go to Hacker News and there aren&#8217;t images unless you click through to the story or read it.  </p>\n\n\n\n<p>A lot of the time there, there isn&#8217;t necessarily an image. Um, but I think for news sites or sites that are meant to emulate a magazine, I mean we call them blogs, but you know, which came first kind of thing. Um, , you need an image. And so with the [00:34:00] magazine that I work with, there&#8217;s, there&#8217;s sometimes there&#8217;s photography, there&#8217;s dedicated photography.  </p>\n\n\n\n<p>They do a lot of fashion spreads. So that&#8217;s, you know, original content. But there&#8217;s also a lot of stories that they go to uns Unsplash or you know, stock Unlimited and they&#8217;re like, we need a picture of a pencil because this is about the pencil factory. And that&#8217;s a bad example. They&#8217;d go take a picture of the pencil factory, but you know what I mean, like we need a picture of trees cuz this is about trees in the northwest and just broadly speaking and so, and then they crop that or whatever.  </p>\n\n\n\n<p>But it&#8217;s, it&#8217;s that, that compelling image that that visual hook, like you said, um, I, I think there&#8217;s, there&#8217;s technically an s e o aspect of it, but for the most part I, I view it more as human cuz these stories don&#8217;t need. Images. Um, but the layouts that, that they&#8217;ve chosen, the [00:35:00] clients have chosen on very different sites, ultimately are very similar in that when you look at an archive page, the emphasis is on lots of compelling images because that&#8217;s what makes humans want to click.  </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Mm-hmm. .&nbsp;  </p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Cory Miller:</strong> So, uh, it, it capturing it and we&#8217;re getting ethereal and I love that because then we&#8217;ll have opinions that we come back down to and say, this sure takes away from this what an image is. Purpose is on a piece of content or on a website. So Hendrick said Emotionalize love that. I think he made up a word.  </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Provide context, draw interest context. Yeah, absolutely. So like I think about in this, um, and go with me here please, but I do a slide presentation. And I&#8217;m doing presentation in front of a bunch of people and I want it to emotionalize, evoke emotion, um, set the mood, [00:36:00] tone, um, context and stuff. But it&#8217;s always that, I think he said it in his last interest.  </p>\n\n\n\n<p>It&#8217;s drawing interest and like Yeah. Color to what you&#8217;re doing. Now, there&#8217;s a host of problems with that in the web. Cause you&#8217;re talking about like Unsplash different things. It&#8217;s like, I personally effing hate trying to hunt down an image. I&#8217;ve done the painful work of trying to write and share and now I gotta go find an image.  </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Right. So we should note that problem. I mean, it&#8217;s, it&#8217;s an obvious one that we know about, but like, it&#8217;s still a problem that factors into what that person&#8217;s trying to get done.&nbsp;  </p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Corey Maass:</strong> Yep. And I picture down the, I, you know, I think it&#8217;s, there, there is this, we keep talking about this workflow. Um, and what we, what we wanna do is shorten, there&#8217;s, there&#8217;s different ways to quantify all the different steps in a workflow, [00:37:00] uh, length of time, ease, you know, general knowledge, um, things that hold your interest.  </p>\n\n\n\n<p>And what we&#8217;re talking about is when we talk about pain, right, is there&#8217;s some steps that are absolutely required. So that&#8217;s another quantifi quantifying element, whether it&#8217;s a required step or not, but it&#8217;s broadly speaking, we&#8217;ve got req a required step of finding an inserting an image, um, that isn&#8217;t fun.  </p>\n\n\n\n<p>And, uh, and we&#8217;re just trying to shorten that. And so we&#8217;re starting with again, Shortening, you know, people go and find images, bring them in. But then hopefully if they, once they&#8217;ve done that work, inserting it is inserting it into the context of the site as a snap once they&#8217;ve got our plugin set up. Um, and then down the road we can also look at integrations.  </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Cuz it was like, [00:38:00] you came to me and you were like, crop.express as a website is great. How do we get this into WordPress? And I said, inserting this into WordPress is not a small lift, but I&#8217;m halfway done with a, with a Chrome extension. So you, again, shortening the step of like, instead of loading a website, just click a button.  </p>\n\n\n\n<p>and it&#8217;ll crop it, you know, in a, in a Chrome extension. And then you and I got talking and it was like, okay, it&#8217;s worth it to do, make the effort to, to make this a WordPress plugin. Um, but, you know, trying to shorten all those steps, uh, and, uh, and integrate with different, uh, you know, capture people where they already are kind of thing.  </p>\n\n\n\n<p>So it&#8217;s, um, you know, if they&#8217;re already in WordPress, then um, then they can do cropping there. If at some point we find that people are using the website, [00:39:00] I mean, what&#8217;s, what&#8217;s to keep us from monetizing the website at some point, right? Like we don&#8217;t have to be a dedicated freemium WordPress plugin. Um, things like Chrome extensions, uh, not off the table, down the road.  </p>\n\n\n\n<p>And then we also could look at, um, integrating with Unsplash, with whatever other, um, Where people are finding, getting their images, finding their images, that kind of thing. Um, and to me, I guess it&#8217;s the, you said something a minute ago about, you know, what is the process and, and how do we know what the process is?  </p>\n\n\n\n<p>And I guess to me, that&#8217;s why I&#8217;m starting to add our functionality in front of, it&#8217;s like you have a storefront and you have lots of doors. And right now we&#8217;ve put some sort of, we&#8217;ve put our code in front of one door, which is the featured image door, but people might be walking [00:40:00] through the media library door, or they might be walking through the block editor door.  </p>\n\n\n\n<p>It&#8217;s like all the ways that people are, WordPress is here, I&#8217;m here and Im, we&#8217;re doing something with images. And so it&#8217;s like, how do we catch people at each door at. Uh, interaction point of them images and WordPress, and so media library, uh, an image block, um, classic editor featured image, classic editor featured image, um, block editor, whatever I just said.  </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Um, you know, a at some point, a c f, you know their forms. Again, any, the idea to me is however we can, we can get in front of people or in between people and images into WordPress.  </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Yep. So, so at [00:41:00] this point, I guess what I&#8217;d say is we&#8217;ve both said a lot of words. . Maybe maybe rephrase the question like what it, you know, I, I, I, I mean I say that to be funny, but we&#8217;re talking about a lot of interesting things. Yeah. Some of it is ethereal. What is it? You&#8217;re, what, what is the question precisely that you&#8217;re trying to have us answer right now?  </p>\n\n\n\n<p>I&#8217;m zooming out&nbsp;  </p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Cory Miller:</strong> from our original thesis, uh, zooming out and trying to get a perspective, and I think you give me really good perspective of, you know, we&#8217;re a part of this process. Our product is a part of a bigger process. Like, last time I looked it up, we, we said, make creative chores fun. This is a chore.  </p>\n\n\n\n<p>It&#8217;s like, I, I wrote this down too for us. I go, you know, my grandmother painted paintings and she was an artist and incredible artist and we&#8217;ve got a lot of our work in our house. The [00:42:00] frame that she picked makes the painting. I was looking at the art itself and I go, it&#8217;s beautiful the frame. Makes it, and it&#8217;s almost like images are the frame of it, right?  </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Mm-hmm. . So back down to utility for a second. I&#8217;m just trying to think. I think this is where we&#8217;re gonna come up with some bells to ring and some opinions of mm-hmm. images, image stuff in, in WordPress and anywhere. It kind of sucks. It&#8217;s a, it&#8217;s a hunt, it&#8217;s a chore. It&#8217;s all that stuff when you&#8217;re just trying to get like powerful writing.  </p>\n\n\n\n<p>And it&#8217;s, the thing most people don&#8217;t do on their websites is do an image. Like I, I&#8217;m on this one book all the time, I love it. No images and it&#8217;s cool, but because she&#8217;s done the pain of creating the content, now it&#8217;s left to this final thing of the chore. But like, here&#8217;s an opinion. We could say images should be your frame of your contents.  </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Like, you know, we&#8217;re talking about emotionalized, wrong answers, provide context. So how do we do that Now, [00:43:00] back down. Thank you for exploring that with me a little bit. I&#8217;d just like to get this bigger perspective cuz sometimes Corey, I&#8217;ve been like, I wanna solve this one problem and I don&#8217;t see the bigger picture zooming out.  </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Now we can zoom back in too and just go like, in an ideal state, finding sizing, finding and sizing are two big design issues. Image, you know, in publishing.&nbsp;  </p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Corey Maass:</strong> And Hendrick just brought up another good one, which I deal with my clients all the time, which is broadly speaking, image metadata. Mm. And so it&#8217;s like, and it&#8217;s a chore and.  </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Because they source images, uh, free images that, that need credit. Or again, they&#8217;re, they&#8217;re having bespoke fashion shoots done and they need to credit the photographer. Um, and all that kind of stuff. I saw, I just saw a plugin yesterday that is [00:44:00] integrating AI with WordPress images to write the alt text for you.  </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Um, which I thought was, I&#8217;m like, that&#8217;s, that&#8217;s a no-brainer. Um, you know, that&#8217;s a problem that&#8217;s desperately n needed to be solved for a while as much because humans are terrible at , this kind of stuff. Yeah. Um, and, and again, non-technical, non s e o people, clients don&#8217;t understand. They&#8217;re like, it&#8217;s a, it&#8217;s a picture of a house in front of two trees, like.  </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Do I say cabin? Do I say house? Do I say trees? Do I say, you know, and it&#8217;s like, even if the AI isn&#8217;t a hundred percent right, I&#8217;d rather it, it, it did something , um, lit literal rather than humans overinterpreting. Cuz some of them were like peaceful setting and you&#8217;re like, no, that&#8217;s not a, technically you&#8217;re right, but that&#8217;s a house with trees.[00:45:00]&nbsp;  </p>\n\n\n\n<p>It&#8217;s not p Google doesn&#8217;t understand what a peaceful setting is, but it&#8217;ll, it&#8217;ll say, it&#8217;ll know that it&#8217;s a picture of a house with trees and read the article that about a peaceful setting and then it will connect the dots. Obviously I&#8217;m being presumptuous about how Google works, but you know, I think that there&#8217;s, there&#8217;s definitely times where there&#8217;s too much human interaction and whatnot.  </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Anyway, I&#8217;m, I&#8217;m ranting, but I do think that part of the bigger problem as we&#8217;re trying to define it here, finding images or sourcing images, images getting, um, inserted correctly. For the theme, for the site, for the design, um, and then metadata. So it&#8217;s that whole last, um, you know, if it&#8217;s a Gantt chart, it&#8217;s the, the last chunk of that Gantt chart of, okay, my story is ready to go.  </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Oh crap, I need an image. And everything that, that involves finding the image, inserting the image, resizing the image, making sure all the metadata on the image is [00:46:00] correct, and then I can publish.&nbsp;  </p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Cory Miller:</strong> Yep. Um, I think what this does for me too is help with marketing. Like when we talk about lead magnets is like, how do you source it?  </p>\n\n\n\n<p>That&#8217;s a easy blog, post lead magnet, something. Um, the other thing is a potential path for us, like we got one part of the thing that we&#8217;ve kind of said. Crop scale, get the right size, um, downstream. We have another path though we could take is like taking the other problem, which is finding, sourcing, not saying we should do it, just saying it is hundred percent option.  </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Yep. Finding sourcing, then. Correct. And it&#8217;s like trying to put this piece pu puzzle together. Um,&nbsp;  </p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Corey Maass:</strong> okay. It&#8217;s like the, there&#8217;s a lot of, there&#8217;s a lot of thinking, writing, talking now in the startup world about, sorry, I&#8217;m rising slowly with my desk, um, [00:47:00] but about not jumping in and building products, which I&#8217;m terrible at.  </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Um, but at. Talking to customers first, defining problems, defining, letting them define solutions, and then that&#8217;s what you&#8217;re supposed to build. I&#8217;m too impatient. I&#8217;m a developer. I&#8217;m a hammer. Everything&#8217;s a nail. Uh, it&#8217;s a problem I have and I&#8217;m, and I&#8217;m fine with it. Um, but I do think that this helps us fill in some of those gaps that are necessary.  </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Right. And it&#8217;s like you said, if we understand the problem, we don&#8217;t have to solve all of them, but it, but the problem is what everybody wants to talk about. You know, you go to a meetup. I was on a, on a virtual WordPress meetup last night. Shout out to the New Hampshire, uh, WordPress meetup. That&#8217;s just getting started again after a long hiatus, which is awesome.  </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Um, you know, but it, it inevitably turns into people [00:48:00] complaining together about similar problems. Oh, we all, all of my clients use, you know, such and such a page builder and it&#8217;s a pain in the butt. And like that&#8217;s how humans. Converse, you know, we share our pain and uh, and it helps us, makes us feel better and not alone.  </p>\n\n\n\n<p>And other people might have suggestions and yada yada. So it&#8217;s like, even if we don&#8217;t ever tackle the problem of sourcing images, it gives us plenty of blog posts to talk about our top 10 places for sourcing images that works really well with crop, you know, integrates nicely with Crop Express or whatever.  </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Um, and helps our customers, our users, broadly speaking with what we know to be a problem overall, even if our product doesn&#8217;t necessarily solve it.  </p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Cory Miller:</strong> So in your work with the media library, are you like in the media library going add new, pulls it up, and then Crop Express comes in? [00:49:00]&nbsp;  </p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Corey Maass:</strong> Okay, so it&#8217;s right now, yeah, it&#8217;s, you know, there is a button, right? You&#8217;re looking at all of your images and there&#8217;s a button at the top that says add new. Just like on every edit screen there&#8217;s an ad, new post, an add, new whatever.  </p>\n\n\n\n<p>And so the, what I have currently, again, I&#8217;m just proving concepts here, still is next to the add new I have, um, uploaded crop. So there&#8217;s a duplicate button because again, I&#8217;m starting to think that we need a way to bypass crop express so that if you want a featured image that isn&#8217;t 16.9, we&#8217;re not getting in your way.  </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Because that&#8217;s how people, that&#8217;s when people are like, screw this. I&#8217;m gonna go uninstall this damn thing, cuz it, it&#8217;s too opinionated or it&#8217;s locking me into something. Um, and so we have to figure that out from a UI perspective or, or UX exp uh, perspective. But, but right now, yes, same, same exact thing.  </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Just like in, [00:50:00] um, the, the block editor featured image, it opens a modal crop, your image, and then that sets your featured image instead of uploading an image into the media library and then using the, the very clunky WordPress image crop, it opens a modal. You upload your image, you crop it easily and quickly, and then it gets injected into the media library.  </p>\n\n\n\n<p>So it&#8217;s really the same flow. Um, again, just trying to kind of be. Insert ourselves in between so that you&#8217;re doing the, the hard part quickly and easily before it, the image gets saved, which I also think is a huge feature. Yeah.&nbsp;  </p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Cory Miller:</strong> And I mean if we do it where the media library is in it&#8217;s now and train people on that workflow, like go there, um, potentially, cuz I was kind of thinking, and I&#8217;m not, don&#8217;t know the technical hurdles, [00:51:00] but back to the keep it installed, how do we keep it installed?  </p>\n\n\n\n<p>We make it an indispensable utility tool. So I was kind of wondering like you got featured image box on the right side of the post Senator and that&#8217;s cool. It&#8217;s right there. It&#8217;s very obvious. Upload, pick, upload, you know, and then crop. So we, we check that box, but I go, okay, back to the keep it installed, making a utility.  </p>\n\n\n\n<p>What did, do we, there&#8217;s one thought just gonna give these raw is that there&#8217;s a left side of the WordPress nav, there&#8217;s crop express menu item go in, they can start manipulating somehow. That&#8217;s probably tied in with the media library, non-developer. Um, the other option is using media library as it is.  </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Third option I was thinking about is right below that feature tab is like, here&#8217;s your, your handy utility tool [00:52:00] right at your fingertips when you&#8217;re in the publishing process. Um, because downstream, like if we did any one of the, like the left, left menu or the right side of the Post-it, I&#8217;m like, put the utility tool right at my fingertips.  </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Mm-hmm. down down that one stream of like the finding. If we decide we want to maybe. to do this. At some point you&#8217;re like, it&#8217;s right there. You&#8217;re, you&#8217;ve done the hard work of writing your post now this tool over here, cause I know there&#8217;s Gutenberg Block h Big Hill to climb on that. So I&#8217;m like right here.  </p>\n\n\n\n<p>I can, you know, it lays the foundation for saying find source potentially. Then step three or two is crop it and put it in. You know, we still have to figure out that gap between post editor, post block editor and here. But I go, I don&#8217;t know. Those are the three things I&#8217;ve been thinking about. But I want your, see what you think about that.  </p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Corey Maass:</strong> Yeah, I like that [00:53:00] idea. Like what jumps out at me is, is a, so we&#8217;re talking about like, you&#8217;re in the dashboard, you&#8217;re not in the con you know, it&#8217;s, it&#8217;s what is, what is cont what is the context, right? So I&#8217;m writing a post, I&#8217;m building a page. Um, And so I&#8217;m inserting images again, like we want, and that&#8217;s where the block I think comes in if people are using the block editor.  </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Um, at some point, I think before we started recording our calls, we talked about, like, I use Beaver Builder, um, and so, and they allow, you know, custom modules and so having a, like, you know, when I&#8217;m building a page or my clients are building a page, insert an image. It&#8217;s not just any image. You&#8217;ve, you&#8217;ve gotten, uh, the, the media library picker, but with our cropper installed again.  </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Um, but anyway, the, the context of you go to media Library to upload and [00:54:00] manipulate images. I&#8217;m sure some people do that. I have a, I don&#8217;t understand the context of it, but I&#8217;m sure some people. Upload images or, or think about images separately, and then they want to go find them when they&#8217;re writing a blog post or something like that.  </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Um, to me, I, that searches WordPress searches terrible. And so trying to upload a whole bunch of images and then go find them out of the workflow, I can&#8217;t even imagine, but I&#8217;m sure people do it. Um, but all that to say, I like your idea of like, I just need to crop an image. I&#8217;m, you know, maybe it&#8217;s the fave icon or maybe there&#8217;s some other context we&#8217;re not thinking about yet, but it&#8217;s like instead of there being a crop express admin menu item, it would say crop and image or, and so it&#8217;s like, it might e and you&#8217;re right, it might even be redundant or somewhat redundant to the media library [00:55:00] integration point, but it&#8217;s like it saves you going to crop express.  </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The website or it saves you having the Chrome extension installed or whatever it is. Um, and so I like that idea of like, again, it&#8217;s, to me it&#8217;s, we&#8217;re, we&#8217;re trying to sort of cast a net and so it&#8217;s wherever we&#8217;re catching people, wherever they&#8217;re dealing with images. Um, and then I just think that, you know, as we, as we continue on our journey, interacting with people, hearing feedback and stuff like that, that it&#8217;s all those points that are then going to be upgraded.  </p>\n\n\n\n<p>So it&#8217;s like here&#8217;s, you know, three or four different contexts where people upload and crop an image. And then if we decide to tackle metadata, okay, so then here, you know, here are the three or four points where people are uploading, cropping an image, adding metadata, or we&#8217;re sucking in metadata or whatever, [00:56:00] again, before they hit publish.  </p>\n\n\n\n<p>So if we can, if we can start with. all those integration points, but I think it&#8217;s, you know, we have to go where people are already integrating or are already interacting, um, rather than ex expecting them to come to us. And&nbsp;  </p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Cory Miller:</strong> without further validation, I go, I think I&#8217;d want it just for my own use case in the right side bar there.  </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Just like to figure and go, okay, I can go here to find that piece. That drives me nuts, which is an image. But I&#8217;m starting to think up here again a little bit and just go, what makes an ima if an image like in a magazine is there to evoke, uh, interest, emotions and all that, what&#8217;s this place? And this is where we get opinionated potentially.  </p>\n\n\n\n<p>It&#8217;s like, what&#8217;s this place in a blog post on a site? Um, and like, [00:57:00] I don&#8217;t know about you, I just abandoned the whole thing because. Just as I, I guess I&#8217;m a design snob, even though I can&#8217;t do that very well, I&#8217;m still a snob about it. Um, but like I, I thought about the post I wrote yesterday. What would I do?  </p>\n\n\n\n<p>What would I do to evoke emotion and interest for the Post I did? You know? And, and that&#8217;s, that&#8217;s a problem I bet with a lot of sourcing. I know content Journey does a lot of, I mean, I think everything they do has featured images, if I&#8217;m not mistaken. So I think we can get really opinionated about that for sure.  </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Especially with our magazine. Newspaper background is like, it&#8217;s about to set the tone, the flavor of what you&#8217;re trying to get across, what&#8217;s that intent? Um, and then we just come back down to the process of like, when you&#8217;re doing that, how does this process work? I love, that&#8217;s what I. To get more feedback on is [00:58:00] how people do that, because they probably go, you&#8217;re doing it all wrong core, you&#8217;re doing it at the back end.  </p>\n\n\n\n<p>You should do it at the front end. I&#8217;m like, okay,&nbsp;  </p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Corey Maass:</strong> tell me more. That&#8217;s true, right? Yeah. And I mean, it&#8217;s all I can say is you and I, and pretty much everybody I&#8217;ve interacted with are,  </p>\n\n\n\n<p>I don&#8217;t wanna say not professionals, but we, we all share the same problem. We&#8217;ve all arrived at the same situation where we&#8217;re, we&#8217;re developing written content. And the image is not necessarily an afterthought, but it&#8217;s the last step of what&#8217;s being handled. Uh, it would, it would be fascinating to me to, to find out that there is some, Doesn&#8217;t New York Times use WordPress or I, they, they&#8217;ve abandoned it and come back [00:59:00] again and, and one of the other New York Post I think does too.  </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Um, and I, they left and came back, or white, white House or whatever. It&#8217;s like to me that those, that&#8217;s the epitome of . The, the WordPress workflow, right? WordPress publishing workflow is if you are, uh, the New York Times or similar and you&#8217;re using WordPress, and so it&#8217;s like, call up the president and find out if he&#8217;s looking for an image before he writes his blog posts.  </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Obviously a joke. He doesn&#8217;t write his own blog post, but that would be fascinating. But I bet we find that this is universal or, or damn near, you know, 80 20. Um, and so yeah, how. we&#8217;re starting with a very small problem that we&#8217;re solving. Where it goes from here would be fascinating. [01:00:00] I what what comes to mind is like, doesn&#8217;t Yost Pro let you put in some keywords and then it helps you rate your content based on those keywords or, or you know, it looks at search results or keyword points, you know, and how you&#8217;re gonna rate for those keywords kind of thing.  </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Like, so I start to,&nbsp;  </p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Cory Miller:</strong> yeah, I love that. Imagine some AI thing going down and going, here&#8217;s a couple of images we either found or created, um, on the site that flash him up a bit. I&#8217;m so funny about my content though, and I just, I&#8217;m trying to unearth a bigger problem here that could really lead a roadmap about is there&#8217;s a.  </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Seems like there&#8217;s a problem. It&#8217;s wonky. The workflow to, to frame evoke interest through images in your content. [01:01:00] Like when you said Element, uh, beaver Builder, and I put Elementor down to you, I&#8217;m like, oh, that&#8217;s right there in that workflow. Great business integration to do. I just talked to Robbie yesterday, by the way, so we could, we could follow up with Robbie on this and he might be a source of really good information.  </p>\n\n\n\n<p>So I&#8217;ll write down, follow up with Robbie&nbsp;  </p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Corey Maass:</strong> again. Yeah. Like what, what does the Beaver Builder team know about how people use their tool? Yeah. Are they, because&nbsp;  </p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Cory Miller:</strong> images are, oftentimes they&#8217;re lame cuz they&#8217;re being pulled from stock. We feel like we need &#8217;em and they just, you know, they&#8217;re obvious stock images, you know?  </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Yeah. Which&nbsp;  </p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Corey Maass:</strong> is, we&#8217;re all used the same ones. .&nbsp;  </p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Cory Miller:</strong> Mm-hmm. . Yep. Which is interesting to me from an AI perspective of like, do something that actually more one off matches the content [01:02:00] and the, and emotions and outcomes you&#8217;re trying to evoke.&nbsp;  </p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Corey Maass:</strong> Yeah. I think we&#8217;re there like, I mean all I&#8217;m seeing for the most part is people on Facebook plugging in some of their images and seeing, you know, here&#8217;s me as Hercules or whatever.  </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Um, but it&#8217;s the image generation or that, you know, the, here&#8217;s a picture of me in the style of da Vinci, or, you know, Monet or whatever, but I, I, there&#8217;ve gotta be people already using AI to generate images. You know, here is an article about X, Y, Z, generate an image, and then that way I don&#8217;t have to pay royalties, I don&#8217;t have to do any searching, you know, if the image is good enough and compelling enough.  </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Um, which is, I mean, also very subjective, like you said, yourself, you&#8217;re picky about your content. So, you know, would AI generated images be enough? I don&#8217;t know. Um, I&#8217;ve got a buddy who runs all of his [01:03:00] images of himself. He&#8217;s a dj and so he has his marketing site and he runs all of his images through like an in Instagram filter that&#8217;s one specific filter.  </p>\n\n\n\n<p>So all of his images look consistent and stylized. And so, you know, the image source is easy for him. It&#8217;s him DJing. Um, but the, the manipulation of the image. It takes a little bit of time, but it, that&#8217;s what makes all of the images of him look cool and different, you know, hip and with it cuz he is a, a dj.  </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Um, you know, rather than just pictures of like, I mean, I, I DJ here in my office, the pictures don&#8217;t look like anything . I may as well be working. Um, yeah. So yeah, there&#8217;s lots of, it&#8217;s, it&#8217;s a big interesting step, uh, of the way we present ourselves [01:04:00] online. And some of it&#8217;s painful, but I also don&#8217;t, I don&#8217;t, I don&#8217;t know yet whether.  </p>\n\n\n\n<p>like there&#8217;s lots of potential ways to integrate ai. I also think it&#8217;s early days of mm-hmm. , like the norms haven&#8217;t been worked out on, on how, how we can use it and how we want to use it. Frankly, like, you know, there&#8217;s for, for everybody who&#8217;s excited for every, everybody who&#8217;s, every person who&#8217;s excited about ai.  </p>\n\n\n\n<p>I feel like there&#8217;s also a person who&#8217;s very apprehensive about like, do I, you know, if every blog post needs an image and so we&#8217;re, but we&#8217;re too lazy to go find the perfect image, then I&#8217;m gonna press a button. AI&#8217;s gonna do its best, and then I&#8217;m just gonna throw that up there because my blog post, somebody told me I have to have an image, but I don&#8217;t really care if that image is, is honestly the best one.[01:05:00]&nbsp;  </p>\n\n\n\n<p>are we contributing to, you know, or AI writing? I mean, it&#8217;s the same argument. It&#8217;s like if, if half the blog posts now are gonna just be written by ai, is it, is it worth it? Are we just continuing to pollute the web with bad writing? You know, we&#8217;re saying the same thing over and over again. So it&#8217;s, all of this stuff I think is really interesting to start writing about or talking about.  </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Um, for me, I, I still think some of the dust needs to settle, um, before we actually look at integrating this stuff. Unless, unless some obvious winner jumps out at us. Yeah, I like&nbsp;  </p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Cory Miller:</strong> it in view of here&#8217;s that conversation going. It&#8217;s gonna only accelerate. And then how do we position crop express where there&#8217;s a convergence point at some point.  </p>\n\n\n\n<p>So, and I think we&#8217;ve identified it&#8217;s the finding sourcing part. All that back, back to here. Cause I wanna make sure I tie back down to ground earth cuz I [01:06:00] don&#8217;t always do this. I get thinking about this going, this is cool, this is something to chase. This is some validation for me of like interest. Um, but it, uh, then I go practical point is like having a utility tool to do my, it was just, so, like Patrick Garman, one of our agency owner members posted like his year end wrap up basically.  </p>\n\n\n\n<p>And you know, looking through the post, I could have read it and imagined he was on an RV trip with his wife and they got to do all these things, but he posted some pictures along the way, you know? Mm-hmm. and, and that was the ideal use. Like seeing one of his picture RV two chairs and looking off, I was like, well that captured the moment right there.  </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Now he sourced those personally from his own camera and media library. Um, I&#8217;m like, if you&#8217;re doing that, You know, images come in from the iPhone, huge not right format. All this stuff, [01:07:00] being able to just go through my media library. You&#8217;re having the problem of like taking off your phone over to your desktop probably.  </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Then you&#8217;re trying to upload it up there. That&#8217;s just a cluster by the way. Just feels like a cluster. But you&#8217;re like, okay, he&#8217;s done all that hunting, searching, finding. Now he comes in, he doesn&#8217;t wanna go to another tool, he is already done all, you know, potentially Dropbox it over. That&#8217;s how I do it anyway.  </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Or, or air dropped it over. Uh, and it seems like when you&#8217;re in there creating the tools should be right there at your right side. That, that&#8217;s where I&#8217;m leaning on these three things we&#8217;ve been talking about. Like media, library, carbon Express thing, and right here where I need it. Mm-hmm. , I don&#8217;t know if it&#8217;s the right, but it tend to be gravitating toward if we&#8217;re gonna make this into a utility suite, um, eventually.  </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Yep. Or want the possibility of it. It seems like that is a good way, is is a good thought, but technically I don&#8217;t know what the hurdles are. Um, you know, the already the post thing is just [01:08:00] like overwhelming to me anyway, but this would be one I&#8217;d want prominent if I&#8217;m gonna be using images.&nbsp;  </p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Corey Maass:</strong> Yeah. And, and I mean, what jumps in jumps in my, to my mind is again, down the road, it&#8217;s like we could start moving upstream and it&#8217;s like somehow you are doing, I mean, we&#8217;re just having fun brainstorming here at the moment, but it&#8217;s like, be the.  </p>\n\n\n\n<p>I, I, I, it used to be delicious. That went out of business. Now I use Pinboard, but it&#8217;s like the, you know, the bookmark keeper. So it&#8217;s like, imagine if like we, we could extend beyond WordPress or beyond, it&#8217;s like you&#8217;re out browsing the web or you&#8217;re on your phone or anywhere that you&#8217;re just kind of like, you&#8217;re collecting, you&#8217;re collecting, you&#8217;re, these are all the potential images.  </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Um, and somehow they all get channeled into like, you wouldn&#8217;t really wanna do this because your media library would [01:09:00] fill up and most hosting companies limit your disc space, whatever. But if you&#8217;re like, you know, I&#8217;m writing a blog post about, you know, my, my RVing trip with my wife. It&#8217;s like, I. Throw images off my phone, I might go and try to source some images from Unsplash and if all of them landed in my media library, uh, cropped correctly, sized correctly, stylized correctly, um, and then I could, and then it, they were there for me to choose from or something like that.  </p>\n\n\n\n<p>So it&#8217;s like, you know, that&#8217;s not, there&#8217;s, there&#8217;s a lot of things wrong with what I just described as an actual product, but, or problem to solve. But it&#8217;s like, we can definitely start looking at again, if, if we get feedback that&#8217;s upstream. Bless you. Um, upstream, you know, part of the problem of sourcing images or finding images or, you know, it&#8217;s like, or even getting them off of our, our devices and into WordPress, if that&#8217;s a pain, [01:10:00] you know, you&#8217;re, If you&#8217;re dropboxing it to your PC and then uploading it from your PC into your media library and then selecting it in your posts, then you know, what&#8217;s the, the one click?  </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Like take it without signing into WordPress from your phone, you know, what&#8217;s the quick share to your WordPress install little utility plugin or something like that. I use a, um, an app on my iPhone called Flight that is free, and it&#8217;s basically for emailing anything to myself. Um, but it uses the share, so it&#8217;s like I&#8217;m browsing.  </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Any website or I&#8217;m in Amazon or whatever and I hit the little share icon and where it gives me the option to airdrop or it gives me the option to post it to Messenger so I can send it to my wife or whatever. Um, there&#8217;s a, a flight option and it opens up a little icon. I hit [01:11:00] post and it sends me an email with a link to whatever I&#8217;m looking at, cuz I&#8217;m in my inbox all day.  </p>\n\n\n\n<p>And that&#8217;s kind of my ends up being my to-do list. And so in theory, you know, again, if we find that this is a huge pain point, there&#8217;s a, I&#8217;m looking through images on my phone. I click share, I click the, the send this to my WordPress install and it&#8217;s preconfigured to crop 16 nine, then it just lands in my, my media library already ready to go.  </p>\n\n\n\n<p>You know, these are problems we can solve technically, once we&#8217;ve defined that there&#8217;s enough people that want that kind of solution.  </p>\n\n\n\n<p>So&nbsp;  </p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Cory Miller:</strong> right now you&#8217;re, you&#8217;re working on the media library thing, um, d but do you like this right sidebar thing? What&#8217;s your thoughts on having it? Do [01:12:00] you crop express you the tool, whatever next version, thoughts or whatever? I&#8217;m trying to think through, uh, product guidance and give you enough.&nbsp;  </p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Corey Maass:</strong> Sure. I mean, I think to me the,  </p>\n\n\n\n<p>right now, the problems that I quote, unquote know we have because I have them and, and I want, if nothing else, I want you to be using this. I want my clients to be using this. I want, um, content journey to be using this is, um, featured image. Media library, uh, block editor, block, classic editor featured image.  </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Those are the four to me, the four known integration points of WordPress and images. And then, and then that way anybody who stall installs this plugin is [01:13:00] going to interact. I mean, if, and Beaver Builder aside, or these other scenarios aside, you know, there&#8217;s, there&#8217;s a very long tail of integration points, but the four primary integration points are covered at that point.  </p>\n\n\n\n<p>And that&#8217;s, that to me is the bay, the, the bare minimum of if anybody installs this plugin, they&#8217;re guaranteed to interact with our plugin and then we can start seeing if it works for people. Yeah.&nbsp;  </p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Cory Miller:</strong> The thing I wanna do on my own is, um, chase this. More metaconcept of like purpose of the image and then just look around and see, you know, where it&#8217;s like images, the opinion I um, thesis of happiness images should add value, not subtract or be a distr distraction.  </p>\n\n\n\n<p>How does that get done? How do people source it? You know? Mm-hmm. , how do we get that thing? There is a SEO value, you know, [01:14:00] from a good image, um, in that, and I, I want to chase that a little bit cause I think it&#8217;s gonna help us, you know, downstream cuz like if we, okay. If we do the thing you were just saying, get all the integration points, the, the basis covered.  </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Yeah. That&#8217;s the free tool. Mm-hmm. to me. And then it&#8217;s like, you want more and better. And this is where we could explore downstream on the paid side is creation, sourcing, finding part of that. And I, I really like that because the free of those, like, here&#8217;s those points you&#8217;re gonna have and we&#8217;re gonna be utility, we&#8217;re gonna help make it easier, this problem easier, you know?  </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Um, and then what it saves us is some of this bigger picture stuff for pro and paid. Like you really want to get serious about it, about doing this better. [01:15:00] This workflow, this outcome you&#8217;re getting. Here&#8217;s&nbsp;  </p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Corey Maass:</strong> paid. Yep. There&#8217;s, there&#8217;s certain WordPress plugins. Because I deal with, because I build web apps, um, and or because I control what my clients see when they sign in.  </p>\n\n\n\n<p>I install user switching, uh, in, on many, many sites. I install duplicate pages. Like these are no-brainer, low lift, low impact. High value. You know, they add a button that frankly should exist in WordPress. And I think that&#8217;s kind of what we&#8217;re talking about here is like, yes, WordPress has cropping, but it&#8217;s dire.  </p>\n\n\n\n<p>And so we are adding simple, basic functionality that arguably should be there or should be upgraded at this point. But where we take that sky&#8217;s the limit. Yeah. But if we can get, if we get to the point, I like that we keep talking about utility, [01:16:00] essentially is like if, if we are the sponge, the, uh, the coat rack, the, you know, the basic thing that every house has to have, um, you know, then, then we&#8217;re just gonna watch installs happen.  </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Mm-hmm. , um, you know, that&#8217;s the dream, right? That hosting companies start recommending us because it&#8217;s just, It&#8217;s gonna save them support tickets. That&#8217;s the dream. Mm-hmm. . And then past that, all this thinking that we&#8217;re doing defines the the business.&nbsp;  </p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Cory Miller:</strong> Okay. Take this for a second. I just wanna quickly sidebar on something.  </p>\n\n\n\n<p>You hit another value add. So if for utility is, you know, making cropping easier, that&#8217;s our been our thesis. Um, you just put a use case. We&#8217;ve talked about beaver builder hosting companies. So I go, what&#8217;s a compelling thing? It&#8217;s okay. [01:17:00] Huge images don&#8217;t help anybody on the web. You know, h ginormous, it takes a dis space.  </p>\n\n\n\n<p>It&#8217;s, you know, bandwidth. It&#8217;s all those things that&#8217;s compelling. Mm-hmm. . So then I go, this is just over here. An idea for us, this is like if, if we, if we take that angle and make this like the rockstar utility and that&#8217;s our base. To showcase. Okay, well you wanna go more? Here it is. Okay. Why would he host recommended it?  </p>\n\n\n\n<p>It&#8217;s like, well, maybe there&#8217;s a tool out here that does this, but like when you put an image, it&#8217;s like, hey, fyi, you&#8217;re think maybe there&#8217;s a module or in the free at some point it&#8217;s like, by the way, this is 1000 million pixels wide, big disk size, it&#8217;s not the right, like some of that&#8217;s in in WordPress already, right?  </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Mm-hmm. True. So true, true. Getting some of those details [01:18:00] to prevent, like it&#8217;s kind of a, for the hosts, kinda like a prevention, by the way, this is gonna help you and the tool right underneath it, A free tool. Is it gonna help you crop that to the right setting? There&#8217;s a compelling value proposition.  </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Mm-hmm. , it&#8217;s like a, and this is 10 year old story, but my mom uses one of our themes and it&#8217;s got rotating images and she&#8217;s like, wow. 15 five megabyte files. That doesn&#8217;t help anybody. Doesn&#8217;t help the user. Right. Doesn&#8217;t help their visitor, doesn&#8217;t help the hosting company that checks a lot of boxes for a utility.  </p>\n\n\n\n<p>So I almost wonder, it&#8217;s like conceptually you&#8217;ve uploaded an image to the media library and it&#8217;s like, hey, this is effing huge size it. Yep. So, I don&#8217;t know, I just want to see, cuz you know, technical, all the, the backend is like, conceptually speaking, you think [01:19:00] this is huge. You probably don&#8217;t even need it up here, but before we put it up here, we can make it better.  </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Yep. Right there. That&#8217;s compelling. It&#8217;s like, You know, people would recommend it and support, because this is a, I&#8217;ve heard enough of this that I think it&#8217;s probably an issue. It&#8217;s like, it&#8217;s not gonna help your bandwidth , it&#8217;s only gonna, you know, most of these hosts have, uh, visitors&nbsp;  </p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Corey Maass:</strong> caps and, and disc space caps and Yeah.  </p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Cory Miller:</strong> And they&#8217;re solving it with CDNs and stuff on the other, you know, other side of it. You&#8217;re like, what if you could be proactive about it and help people get better images?&nbsp;  </p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Corey Maass:</strong> Right. Well, and that&#8217;s, I mean, like, that goes back too to the, you know, creating, creating images, helping users create images that work with the themes, the theme and the design overall.  </p>\n\n\n\n<p>It&#8217;s like if, if everywhere on your site you&#8217;ve got. Square images, why are you up uploading 16, nine featured image? You know? So it&#8217;s, um, you know, all part and parcel of, um, [01:20:00] the, the sort of cynical way of saying it is like protecting people from themselves. Um, but that&#8217;s, that&#8217;s like you said, on all fronts, the disk size, uh, or the image size, the space that it takes.  </p>\n\n\n\n<p>So there&#8217;s bandwidth issues, um, you know, and making it look good the way humans view it. So, um, but yeah, I mean the, the upsell again, be by becoming a utility. Like there&#8217;s a number of, um, hosting companies that recommend certain plugins that have white list, white lists of recommended plugins or incurred, you know, and some of them I don&#8217;t, I don&#8217;t know.  </p>\n\n\n\n<p>I&#8217;m not on enough hosts anymore to know, like, do they come that most of them have their own plug-in installed, but they don&#8217;t necessarily like pre-install a bunch of plug-ins for you. But, um, you know, but again, all good marketing copy, um, good relationships to be [01:21:00] building and, and taking advantage of. And, um, you know, and we, and in, in, in the inverse right, is hosting companies that we recommend working with that are trying to solve this problem.  </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Again, kind of protect, protect people from themselves. If you&#8217;re non-technical, these are things, you know, ideally you&#8217;re not even having to think about. Well, and&nbsp;  </p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Cory Miller:</strong> give me another per person to put people to put on this. Um, asking about problems is hosting companies. Mm-hmm. , so probably hit up Jess from principal and some of my different contexts, but like from the utility value prop.  </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The alone. This doesn&#8217;t get us to revenue as fast, but it&#8217;s like, get installed or get recommended. Huge. So the value prop, like if we can hit the value prop for the user, the end user, the agency, the hosting in a very simple, elegant way, just solve these little problems. Yeah. It&#8217;s like we, we all become the [01:22:00] defacto, um, recommended tool.  </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Like Hendrick was saying, okay, it&#8217;s it&#8217;s forms, it&#8217;s seo, it&#8217;s this, it&#8217;s that. You know, like, why not put it up there? Maybe we&#8217;re not that tier, but we&#8217;re second tier in that recommended of like making your images better for everybody. Mm-hmm. . So that&#8217;s what made me think about as you&#8217;re working on the media library stuff is simple ways to say, this is really big, you know, why don&#8217;t you like, hey, two, two parts, just one is it&#8217;s huge.  </p>\n\n\n\n<p>You don&#8217;t need it. You know, the file size is way too big. Way too big margin. The second I thought of is like, I didn&#8217;t think about this until you said this, but themes have recommended default ratios, right? So it&#8217;s like we can go back to Cadence, beaver, builder, elementary, whoever it is, and go like, can you give us those?  </p>\n\n\n\n<p>What are those standard if we [01:23:00] can&#8217;t find them? But I was even thinking like, I wish that information was in the theme that could be displayed in there. It&#8217;s like, you need&nbsp;  </p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Corey Maass:</strong> four by three. Well, and there&#8217;s, um, like you can install a c f. If you own an A C F license, you can install a c f, um, you know, preconfigured essentially.  </p>\n\n\n\n<p>So the client doesn&#8217;t know that it&#8217;s being used, but it&#8217;s, it&#8217;s integrated. Um, and so I&#8217;m envisioning ways, um, of our functionality being integrated with constants being defined in the code. And so it&#8217;s like you install the, uh, the golf course theme and it&#8217;s, and it&#8217;s, it&#8217;s beautiful. If it has 16, nine images and so hard coded into the theme is anywhere you&#8217;re uploading an image, again, media library featured images, Gutenberg block is, you know, [01:24:00] all you can, it, it, it throws up the cropper and says, you know, the theme you have installed has 16 nine defined, you know, will let you break that if you want to, but, , you know, you, you should probably do what they tell you and then your site will come out beautiful.  </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Um, and, and like you said too of like, um, I like starting that conversation. Like there&#8217;s a, there&#8217;s a chicken or egg, right? Like you can&#8217;t warn, you can&#8217;t tell people the image you&#8217;re uploading is too big. You should install the, our plugin if you, because that&#8217;s functionality we would build into our plugin, so they&#8217;d already have to have it installed.  </p>\n\n\n\n<p>But having the option, uh, or having it throw up a warning that&#8217;s like, you know, our, this is going to get cropped to a recommended 1200 pixels. We noticed that it&#8217;s, you&#8217;ve uploaded one that&#8217;s 10,000 pixels. Do you want, is there some compelling reason that [01:25:00] you want this bigger? Obviously, like we&#8217;re, we&#8217;re saying this conversationally, but.  </p>\n\n\n\n<p>But I like that kind of thing. Like co you know, we&#8217;re helping people, we&#8217;re protecting people from themselves, but we&#8217;re not also, we&#8217;re also not gonna, like, like I said, right now, I think the, the product is too opinionated, um, that you can&#8217;t get around the plugin, which isn&#8217;t, you know, is gonna piss some people off.  </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Um, but we can, we can help people conversationally or functionally as a user.&nbsp;  </p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Cory Miller:</strong> This is a problem I&#8217;ve had forever, you know? Yeah. And as on the other side is you build a cool theme or product and people can make it as like, ugly as you want. You know? This seems like an idea to go, like we just need, I think we&#8217;re talking about first Dominoes is we&#8217;ve got hosting, we&#8217;ve got some set of use cases, like your clients come to Journey, different things.[01:26:00]&nbsp;  </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Now we&#8217;ve got theme providers. , that could be a domino for us because, you know, I just put down here Cadence and Kathy&#8217;s aunt because she&#8217;s doing, um, community marketing at Cadence and just going like, can you, can you give me a little bit of time? Tell me what the problems that users have with this and what you all have with this.  </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Like, seriously, we went to all this time and effort to make it a beautiful template and you effed it up, you know? Yeah. Um, and it&#8217;s like  </p>\n\n\n\n<p>the banner there is help, you know, this tool with this integration points, the four, I wanna write those down by the way, cause I didn&#8217;t get to write those down. But the four integration points, um, could be a way to get this adopted. Again, chick Egg, but like, cool. You know, is it interesting to you and I to make this a free utility that potentially builds a bigger snowball [01:27:00] down there?  </p>\n\n\n\n<p>What&#8217;s&nbsp;  </p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Corey Maass:</strong> your answer? Hey, if we get internet famous off of a free plugin, I&#8217;m okay with that too. You know, like we, like we talked about on, in our first call, all of this is a bit of an experiment and, and I think we&#8217;re by, by talking about it publicly, we&#8217;re making it more of an experiment than it would be if we weren&#8217;t.  </p>\n\n\n\n<p>But we&#8217;re both, we&#8217;re both approaching it that way. We&#8217;re not, we&#8217;re not having a ha you know, meeting and having a hackathon and going, this has to make us a million dollars, uh, tomorrow. Yeah. And so there&#8217;s, there&#8217;s, and neither of us are, I, I think we&#8217;d both love it to make us some money or to lead to something that makes us some money.  </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Uh, it becomes a, a, a revenue stream for us individually and or may it becomes a business, um, or whatever that looks like. Um, you know, [01:28:00] but we&#8217;re open to non-obvious or not immediate apparent, immediately apparent. Benefits here. And so, you know, being the person behind a utility plugin that has millions of active installs, some good is gonna come from that and probably some revenue in some way is gonna come from that.  </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Even if crop Express becomes itself, becomes a lead magnet for some other plugin, we&#8217;d, if we crop express, we, we end up creating Image Express that integrates with all of the free image sourcing and, and that&#8217;s purely a paid product or something, you know, so, so that&#8217;s kind of, I think to me, we&#8217;re still there.  </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Do you&nbsp;  </p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Cory Miller:</strong> have image.express? Because if not, go by it. Please. , we&#8217;re all by for you because I think we need that. Um,&nbsp;  </p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Corey Maass:</strong> okay. Everybody listening is scrambling right now to go see if that&nbsp;  </p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Cory Miller:</strong> hang. You&#8217;ve got a five second delay, so see how fast you [01:29:00] type. Yeah. Okay. No kidding. . Takeaways? Takeaways and next steps. Um, I need to do my original to-do from last week, which is like, just have a conversation with a couple of these people on my list.  </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Mm-hmm. , um, you&#8217;re continuing to work on the integration points Media library is next. Is that right? Okay. Yeah. Anything else you need from me?  </p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Corey Maass:</strong> I just wanna, sorry, ,&nbsp;  </p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Cory Miller:</strong> he&#8217;s, he&#8217;s getting domain guys. Um,&nbsp;  </p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Corey Maass:</strong> nope, it&#8217;s taken.  </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Hey, I mean, I, I feel lucky that, and of course it&#8217;s parked, um, I feel lucky that I got Crop Express and the other, the couple of other domains like that, that I have. Um, but, um, photo Express . But anyway, um, yeah, I, I feel like I continue to, my, my [01:30:00] to-dos are to continue to cover, cover those, those functional.  </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Feature the feature bases that we&#8217;ve talked about, um, those integration points. And you, you start having conversations about, like, cuz I, to me, we, we know, well we&#8217;re, we&#8217;re again, we&#8217;re still at truly laying the foundation. We&#8217;re pouring the slab. Like this is a no-brainer. No matter what kind of house we build, we need the cement that we&#8217;re gonna build off of.  </p>\n\n\n\n<p>So, um, I have no hesitation about continuing to build at least the, the next few features that we&#8217;re talking about. Okay.&nbsp;  </p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Cory Miller:</strong> Awesome man. Okay, I got my marching orders. How the combos yours keep your, keep on your work with the integration media library points. Um, yep. I was cueing up a question in the agency on [01:31:00] your channel to say, how do you use your, how do your clients use images?  </p>\n\n\n\n<p>I&#8217;ll wait until after my next meeting, which starts in just a minute. But thanks&nbsp;  </p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Corey Maass:</strong> brother. Yeah, great to talk to you again.&nbsp;  </p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Cory Miller:</strong> I love doing philosophy and productivity  </p>\n\n\n\n<p>but seriously, this is context for what I used to formulate marketing messages and approach, and I think it&#8217;s invaluable to product as we understand the problem, you know, and we&#8217;re understanding, I should say. Mm-hmm. , it&#8217;s always evolving and then we&#8217;ll find the point. But I really like where we landed, which is for.  </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Pre plug in super uber utility, keep going to those low lift things that we can kind of keep adding value with some avatars that we added, which is hosting agencies end user kind of thing. And then, um, just get, keep the feedback loop going. Yep. All right, my friends. You good? Thanks for your time. All right.  </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Bye.</p>\n<p>This article was published at Post Status — the community for WordPress professionals.</p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Fri, 10 Mar 2023 15:42:52 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:11:\"Cory Miller\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:40;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:92:\"Post Status: Interview With Product Lead Brandon Dove Of Pixel Jar — Post Status Draft 144\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:32:\"https://poststatus.com/?p=148081\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:99:\"https://poststatus.com/interview-with-product-lead-brandon-dove-of-pixel-jar-post-status-draft-144/\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:34818:\"<div class=\"is-layout-flow wp-block-group eplus-wrapper has-theme-palette-2-color has-theme-palette-8-background-color has-text-color has-background\"><div class=\"wp-block-group__inner-container\"><div class=\"wp-block-post-excerpt\"><p class=\"wp-block-post-excerpt__excerpt\"><a href=\"https://twitter.com/brandondove\">Brandon Dove</a>, co-founder of <a href=\"https://twitter.com/pixel_jar\">Pixel Jar</a>, joins <a href=\"https://twitter.com/corymiller303\">Cory Miller</a> to discuss his WordPress plugin, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/adsanityplugin\">AdSanity Plugin</a>.

They discuss how the <a href=\"https://twitter.com/adsanityplugin\">AdSanity Plugin</a> works and what lessons Brandon has learned about the relationship between agency operations and product development.</p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio\"><strong>Top Takeaways:</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<ul type=\"video\" class=\"wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio\">\n<li><strong>Recurring Product Revenue.</strong>While it can be challenging for an agency to balance custom service work with product development, having a product that generates recurring revenue can provide a cushion and diversify the overall business revenue. AdSanity is a successful example of this, and the team is working on dedicating more resources towards the product to even out development between the two sides of their business. However, it can be difficult to maintain free plugins without generating revenue, and it&#8217;s important to consider how to incorporate them into the business model.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Value vs. Spam in Advertising.</strong> For many people, advertising has become a four-letter word, so there is a need to help customers become good advertisers rather than just spamming ads everywhere. It’s critical to empower your visitors by explaining the importance of creating a community around the site to allow for more meaningful conversations with visitors.&nbsp;</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>The Point of Free Plugins. </strong>Building free plugins is more about passion and community engagement than being a lead generator. The main outcome has been connecting with people within the WordPress community, but those connections remember to come to you for solutions. So the increased exposure can lead to revenue in the long term.</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\">\n\n</div>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"is-layout-constrained wp-block-group\"><div class=\"wp-block-group__inner-container\">\n<h3 id=\"GoDaddy-Pro\"><img src=\"https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/14.0.0/72x72/1f64f.png\" alt=\"🙏\" class=\"wp-smiley\" /> Sponsor: <a href=\"https://poststat.us/godaddypro\">GoDaddy Pro</a></h3>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"is-layout-flex wp-container-24 wp-block-columns\">\n<div class=\"is-layout-flow wp-block-column\">\n<p>Manage your clients, websites, and tasks from a single dashboard with GoDaddy Pro.

This is another interview in the series called Product People, and I&#8217;m talking to my longtime friend, uh, an agency owner and product founder Brandon Dove. Today to talk about Ad Sanity, a WordPress plugin that helps you, um, helps site owners. Um, Well, I&#8217;ll let you tell that in just a second, but , um, you&#8217;ll be seeing ad ad sanity on posts very soon cuz I meant to mention this before we started recording.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It&#8217;s something that we need. Need for the site. All right. And I&#8217;m like, great longtime friend product, product member, um, has the key solution. Anyway. Um, Brandon, would you tell us a little bit for those of you that don&#8217;t know you, and, and, uh, tell us a little bit about what you do, uh, your work in WordPress from both product and services side?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Brandon Dove:</strong> Yeah, uh, thanks having me on by the way. And, um, yeah, so, uh, I run a, a company called Pixel Jar. [00:01:00] That, uh, we&#8217;ve been doing WordPress stuff for a very long time. Um, we started our business in 2004 and, um, you know, just, uh, through our work with not only clients and, and services that we provide, um, have, have found sort of a, a niche in building plug-ins for our, our customers.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And, um, some of those are great one-time use things for our customers, but. , in other cases, they&#8217;re, they&#8217;re bigger, sort of, um, needs amongst the community. And so, uh, our product Ad Sani launched from just such a, uh, an instance where we had a, a customer who was, who had a wedding blog that was highly trafficked.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>They had been using another plugin that was just tanking their site. And so at the time, you know, we decided to build them a custom solution for advertising and it worked for them. Um, it kept their site up and, and kept making them [00:02:00] money. And so we talked to them about like releasing it to, to the broader community to see if people would be able to benefit in the same way.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And, um, they were agreeable to that. And, um, yeah, we, we put it out in the market.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Cory Miller:</strong> Well, I want to talk about that, that whole experience too, because I know a lot of people on the on agencies go, &#8220;Hey, what if we did this product?&#8221; And you&#8217;ve done this unique organic experience that came out of. Um, your work, which I think is so cool for agencies to think about that there might be an opportunity to do a product.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And I&#8217;ve seen so many agencies like you, you know, this, uh, friends of ours that have done products, well, maybe they haven&#8217;t monetized directly from them, but it&#8217;s been a part of their portfolio and all that kind of stuff. So, um, how has that experience agency and then having this product. That you&#8217;d like, you work on, I know you&#8217;re passionate about it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I&#8217;ve talked to you in the pa part about it, but tell me from that agency experience, what that journey has been like. [00:03:00]</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Brandon Dove:</strong> Uh, yeah, it&#8217;s, it&#8217;s tricky for sure, right? Um, you know, our core services are, um, taking care of our customers, our clients who come to us and need more custom solutions, like that&#8217;s our bread and butter.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Um, but you know, as agencies, it&#8217;s, it&#8217;s great to be able to. You know, sort of, um, get past the ebb and flow of work to have a, a baseline of income that&#8217;s recurring revenue from a product kind of type of, uh, business. And so that&#8217;s, that&#8217;s sort of where, you know, we really focus on ad sanity to, to provide that for us is, is that that cushion to really start off our month every month with like, okay, we&#8217;re gonna, we&#8217;re gonna make this much money.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We can, you know, we can. Uh, count on that. And, um, so then it&#8217;s like, uh, from an organizational standpoint, how do we focus time on this when we&#8217;ve got clients who are saying, Hey, I, I need you to complete this work by this deadline, or whatever. You know, that that push and [00:04:00] pull of product development in that is, is sometimes really tricky.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Um, I&#8217;ve talked to some product only houses that say it&#8217;s just not possible to do well, um, between products and services. And in some days I definitely feel like that it&#8217;s, it&#8217;s really hard to, um, especially for a small team like ours, to, you know, please everybody all the time. And, um, so we&#8217;ve, we&#8217;ve set.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Over the years at Sandy Launch in 2011. So it&#8217;s been around for a long time. Um, and so throughout that time we&#8217;ve spent, um, you know, a lot of time on it in some instances and also in some instances, not a lot of time because client services had a ramped up. So we&#8217;re, um, we&#8217;re in the middle of trying some, some more dedicated resources towards the product to even out development, um, between the two different sides of our business.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And, um, it&#8217;s a work in progress, right now ?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Cory Miller:</strong> So I appreciate that. I think hearing [00:05:00] that Will is gonna be help a lot of people as they&#8217;re thinking through this. Cuz I think there&#8217;s this perpetual, you know, pressure to say, do I have a product when you&#8217;re doing client services? But then I talk to so many people that are very, very happy doing client work only.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Yeah. Um, And then some people like me that have failed miserably at client work and go, well, it&#8217;s product. So I think it&#8217;s cool. It&#8217;s been around very long time. Um, it makes money. Uh, and now it seems like what I hear too is it&#8217;s an opportunity to even diversify your overall business&#8217; revenue. Yep. And, um, I know you&#8217;re, you&#8217;re passionate about product, like this is something you&#8217;ve poured into with that sanity in particular, just talking to you in the past.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So, um, I think that&#8217;s all, um, super cool to hear, hear, and then it has potential. Mm-hmm. . It could stay here and we&#8217;d be happy with it, but it has more potential if we might put some in there. And I think that&#8217;s a, that&#8217;s a really nice [00:06:00] place to be in the product space. Like we said, there&#8217;s plugins out there that, you know, agencies maintain for themselves that probably don&#8217;t make, you know, money.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Sure. Um, but are those portfolio pieces,</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Brandon Dove:</strong> and I think that&#8217;s one of, that&#8217;s a, it can be a drag like, um, We&#8217;ve put out free plug-ins before we ever put out paid plug-ins and supporting that as a service. Is really hard, right? Like if you have plug-ins that aren&#8217;t making you money, but they&#8217;re useful to the community, sometimes you put those out there and say, well, some people might be able to use this.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Those often get unsupported. They don&#8217;t, they don&#8217;t really ever change code because, you know, unless you have a very large team. Um, but, uh, It, it, it&#8217;s hard because you&#8217;re like, well, how do I, how do I put that into my business, uh, if I&#8217;m not making money off of it, but I have customers or clients who are paying me.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So that, that, that is tricky. I think if you have a free plugin. But, um, ad sanity started really [00:07:00] small, um, really lightweight, really basic as far as ad plug-ins go, but over time we added functionality through add-ons and things like that, that made it more robust.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Cory Miller:</strong> Well, tell me about the plugin itself. Uh, I&#8217;ve, I&#8217;ve obviously used it, but tell us a little bit about where the product is today, and then I&#8217;ll ask you where you&#8217;re kind of go, what your thoughts and ideas are for the future for the plugin.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Brandon Dove:</strong> Yeah, so the, at the core of Ad Sanity, it&#8217;s just, it&#8217;s a custom post type. So for developers out there or people who are very familiar with WordPress, it, it&#8217;s, it utilizes a lot of WordPress core functionality, which is what we wanted, right? We didn&#8217;t want to build independent systems that we&#8217;re gonna add to WordPress.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We wanted to make sure that we tied in as closely as possible to the WordPress editing experience. So, Any user could pick it up and, and build with it. And so, um, out, out of the box, it&#8217;s, you know, custom post type that supports a featured image. So if you have a relationship with a, an advertiser, you can take their, their ad assets, [00:08:00] dump &#8217;em into a featured image, and we use a lot of the built-in WordPress, um, queries and things like that to keep things really, keep things really performant. And you know, we have different blocks, widgets, template tags, like all sorts of different WordPress implementations to be able to display those in different ways on your site.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Like that&#8217;s, Outta the box. That&#8217;s the very, very basic stuff. We also support, um, ad ad networks. So we have a, an area where you can dump in ad network code if you want to use an ad sense or some other, um, ad network, you can just pop that in there. Um, and over time we added also HTML five ads, which was really, um, a lot of our customers were asking for and even just plain text ads.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Um, so you have some customization of a look and feel of those things, but, um, that&#8217;s sort of out of the box core functionality. Um, I think there&#8217;s some other things I&#8217;m probably glossing over, but, um, we, we created some additional add-ons to. [00:09:00] You know, enhance the functionality of the things that you might expect of expirations on impressions instead of just, um, like date-based ranges of like start and end dates.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Um, we have conditional advertising, so like, You can say, only show these ads on these categories. Um, but you have an ad group that has lots and lots of ads in it, so you can really slice and dice and display those, um, those ads where you want them, or based on user, user type or lots of different things.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Um, we&#8217;ve got a way for advertisers to get self-service reporting, so if you do build relationships through advertisers, they can log in. See all views, clicks, and click through, rate, all that stuff on their own. So you don&#8217;t have to provide those to all your, your customer or your advertisers. Um, yeah, there&#8217;s, there&#8217;s probably like a, a few other I&#8217;m missing, but I think those are like some of the popular ones, um, that are on top of my head.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Cory Miller:</strong> Yeah. The ability to put ads on your [00:10:00] WordPress site. Um, uh, this, its, uh, I can assume will always exist, but. You know, trying to monetize onto the site and it does it very freshly Well, I was trying to remember when I logged in, seeing all the down the add-ons there for a second to help to, to share some isol.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Um, well, okay, so that&#8217;s where the plugin is now. And, and I wanna just talk a little bit before we talk about the future of what you&#8217;re trying to do with the plugin. I know a high value from you, from me and friends as long as we have talking about this product in particular, that you have a, you threaded align with this because.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>You know, value, personal values, business values too. And in the subject of advertising, it&#8217;s always this tricky like, line. Yeah. To, uh, to, to, to walk. So tell me about that. I, I know cuz we&#8217;ve talked about this subject is, you know, you, I go to this, I can&#8217;t remember what the side is, but I&#8217;m like, man, I&#8217;ve got one answer by one inch square to actually.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>What the text is and everything else is [00:11:00] video. And I know from past like that&#8217;s one of the things I know you always card against. How do you navigate that line with the product?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Brandon Dove:</strong> I think like more and more lately, you know, advertising is sort of like, um, a four letter word almost. You know, people are like, I, I&#8217;ve got an ad blocker on my, my browser because I don&#8217;t wanna see 17,000 ads when I&#8217;m just trying to read an article.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Right. And, and more big publishers are starting to go, okay, well, like, hold on a second. We were, we rely on that money. To, um, to be able to create this content. So I think what, what that&#8217;s really led us to is how can we help all of our customers, our insanity customers, be good advertisers or good publishers, and not just spam.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Ads everywhere, all over their site. Um, and so we&#8217;ve done a lot of, um, writing on our site about, you know, best practices for advertising. Um, we actually have another ad-on, which is, um, [00:12:00] is an ad block detection because we want, we want our, to empower our publishers to start that conversation with their visitors, right?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We want them to be able to say, , I appreciate that you&#8217;ve got an ad blocker. I&#8217;ve got one too, or whatever, but here&#8217;s why I have ads on my site. You know, I&#8217;m a small team of, of content creators. We rely on these advertisements to pay our bills. You know, either could you turn off your, your ad blocker for our site, you know, like, like whitelist us or in some cases we&#8217;ve been talking.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Creating a membership so that people become members to your site and you can disable using the conditional ads add-on. You can disable ads for users who are logged in or at a certain level. Um, so again, it creates, um, more of a community around your site. It allows you to, to connect with people who are visiting your site and actually have more meaningful conversations.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>With them, um, and, and give them the kind of content that they want. Um, and, and in addition, be able to [00:13:00] provide advertising that&#8217;s relevant to those people. So not only are they not turned off by the advertising, they&#8217;re actually more willing to like look into those, those advertisements because it&#8217;s something they&#8217;re you&#8217;re already writing about or something that&#8217;s related to your content.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Cory Miller:</strong> I, I love that for two reasons. One is because, um, giving somebody an option that. , um, you know, like developer and explaining why we&#8217;re doing this. I mean, post status.com, we take advertising in the form of sponsorships. We want people to see those and say thank you. And those advertisers have like goals, objectives, they wanna meet a part of that. And so it&#8217;s like balancing that. I know, I know this, so I love that. You&#8217;re like, Hey, I know you don&#8217;t like it. Here&#8217;s a path to help support us. Mm-hmm. . And then the second. Um, the ability from just a business model standpoint to go, you don&#8217;t like &#8217;em, turn &#8217;em off.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Like come into, it&#8217;s a great introduction to membership and that&#8217;s, you know, [00:14:00] particularly during Covid, Brandon, I&#8217;m sure you saw this too, is like the rise in the. anecdotal data from friends around the sphere. Yeah. Is like membership sites were really hot core sites. L m s stuff was really hot and for good reason, people kinda left, has had a little bit more time and thought I&#8217;ll do my pet project and stuff.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Yep. And I think this is that line you, you kind of balance with any kind of membership is. Strong enough front facing content to attract people to the membership. And I love that you&#8217;ve got a path for people to use, um, with, with those two scenarios. Mm-hmm. , hey, you don&#8217;t like it? We don&#8217;t either, but here&#8217;s an opportunity and then a way to go.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I want to pay for the non-advertising version and to do that programmatically. I pr think it&#8217;s pretty spectacular. Yeah.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>All right. What, what, what else did I miss on, on that part? I love that you mentioned that particular add-on. Is there anything else that came to mind before I start talking about [00:15:00] the future and what you&#8217;re trying to do?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Brandon Dove:</strong> I think one thing that I just, just, it&#8217;s not specifically related to this, but one thing I, I did forget to mention when we were talking about agencies or like being an agency and having products is, um, what we have found in having ad sanity is there, there&#8217;s always people who want customizations, right? Like we get that as an agency. People come in and they&#8217;re like, Hey, we&#8217;ve got these seven plugins. We need &#8217;em to work better together. Or we have, you know, this one plugin that we just need to tweak another 10% to get exactly.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Have it exactly do what we want. And as a product developer, it, it gives you like core knowledge about this plugin. Like I know how to modify ad sanity. Any use case probably. And so we have, like, we&#8217;ve had people come to us like looking for ad sanity and, and seeing it as a good platform, but they need another 10%, or in some cases they need an entire add-on built for it, um, to do what they want.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And, and that has been a huge revenue generator for, [00:16:00] for Pixel Jar. Um, and, and so like that, that, you know, Cross-selling opportunity. I think as far as an agency and a product space is, is actually really great.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Cory Miller:</strong> Well, we really didn&#8217;t go deep into that, but I a hundred percent agree and I&#8217;m not from the a agency side, but I go a project that can generate work or an name brain that just being out there and knowing that you might have a plugin that somebody might go, huh, it&#8217;s a cool plug.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I wonder who, who does it. And it&#8217;s this awesome agency. Could lead to a lot, a lot of work. And then I know there&#8217;s companies in space and you got, you all might do this too, is companies approach you to build their integration plugin and continue to maintain it. And so you&#8217;re like mm-hmm. . I, I think that&#8217;s an excellent, I&#8217;m glad you came back to that because an excellent way to build the marketing exposure and, uh, drive revenue to your business.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Yeah. Even [00:17:00] some of the ones, like our friends over at WebDev Studios, I know they&#8217;ve got custom post op ui and I think to myself, what a great calling card. Yeah. Because I think it&#8217;s installed over a million times on the repo. And, um, but what a great calling card, you know, to say when you&#8217;re talking to a client or to get, be out there in the mainstream.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Um, how have the free plugins you&#8217;ve done in the past worked? Um, there, there&#8217;s bound to be some net effect that&#8217;s helped, but how has that experience gone from the free.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Brandon Dove:</strong> Um, it&#8217;s difficult, right? Like, um, I would say some of &#8217;em are, um, you know, used on a couple thousand blogs or something like that. Like nothing to the extent of custom post type ui, um, which is a fantastic plugin.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We use that several times. Um, but, uh, but yeah, like, uh, for. It&#8217;s, it&#8217;s more of like the passion for the community that gets us to put those out. Um, the first, I think the first free plugin I [00:18:00] put out was because in 2009, There was a plug-in competition in New York, uh, word Camp New York, that, uh, it just, as a developer, it was a way for me to engage with that community.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Like I had never been to New York before. And, uh, because there was that plug-in competition where you were gonna be on stage and, and kind of talking about the plug-in you built, um, and you had to have a team that was, um, distributed. So you had to work with people, uh, that weren&#8217;t just in your company or whatever.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So, um, I got the, the opportunity to work with people that would&#8217;ve never worked with otherwise. Uh, I flew out to New York to, to present, um, the plugin and, and I think that was like my favorite experience for building like a free plugin because, um, you know, being part of that WordPress community feeling, the collaboration was, was pretty awesome. I, I think for me it&#8217;s more of a, it has to be more about the passion in, in that case than, you [00:19:00] know, having it be really like a, a lead generator in a lot of cases.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Cory Miller:</strong> Yes, absolutely. And I mean, I would think the better, it helps showcase your core expertise, the work you do, um, e even better.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So, yeah, I like that. All right. Well, Let&#8217;s talk about the future of added sanity and what you got planned and what you&#8217;re thinking about, um, a little bit more in depth. So what&#8217;s next for the, the product?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Brandon Dove:</strong> Uh, that&#8217;s a good question. Like I said, um, we are, uh, we&#8217;re experimenting with dedicated resources for the, the product.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So while we continue to maintain it, build new features here and there, it&#8217;s not as like, it, it&#8217;s, we don&#8217;t have a dedicated team to it. So, um, it, it, it can, sometimes development can come sometimes slow. So I think that&#8217;s, that&#8217;s part of our plans next year is, is really to dedicate resources to it. We, we are also as [00:20:00] many plugins are, um, sort of like finding our way with all of the new block editing stuff.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We, we addressed a lot of our core functionality with block editing. Um, we integrated with a couple page builders at the same time. But I mean, the, the way site editing is evolving, um, will probably. Further and deeper than we expect. And so we&#8217;ve been following a lot of the, the development on, on site editing and Gutenberg and, and all of that stuff.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And I think you know what it means for us, like I am, I&#8217;m a backend more PHP focused developer. So what it means for us is really, you know, fully embracing more JavaScript life, um, and, and becoming, uh, You, you know, more in tune and more ingrained with what, with what WordPress is offering at its core.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Because that was our initial mantra is like being, [00:21:00] being very, um, focused on what WordPress offers out of the box and making it an easy to use experience. So I think like the, the big thing that we&#8217;ve been focusing on is trying to plan, how do we want to integrate with, with the site editing experience in a better way and, um, , you know, how does that rework our entire user interface potentially.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Um, and also as a product developer who&#8217;s been around for a long time, how do we not alienate customers that have been with us for years and years and years?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Cory Miller:</strong> So, Yeah, that we could do a whole public podcast series on how to balance like agency time and resources with the, with that product. Mm-hmm. , um, for sure.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And that equation, when does it make sense? But I was right in here, some of the reasons we&#8217;ve talked about why an agency might consider doing a product and one, I was just thinking, I know you&#8217;ll do this part of your client work, but the product is probably an excuse too [00:22:00] to. Dig in and really stay in touch with full side where the software itself is going.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Yeah. Uh, in addition to like flexing your expertise muscle and all that.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Brandon Dove:</strong> And Beyond that, it&#8217;s, it&#8217;s like we&#8217;re in charge. Right? A another benefit of an agency with a product is like all day you work servicing clients who have requests for you to do exactly what they say, but when you&#8217;re a product owner, you get to decide what gets built.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Like you might have customers who are saying, Hey, we need this feature. But you ultimately get to decide like, do I wanna build that feature? Do I wanna support that feature? Is it good for the broader customer base that I have? Um, so there&#8217;s some freedom in that as well.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Cory Miller:</strong> Yeah, like a change of pace too, you know.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Mm-hmm. , um, like you said, I, I got change of pace when you said that. It&#8217;s like, okay, we have to do what the client ultimately wants over here, potentially, but over here we get to like make our way and see, and that creative freedom freedom&#8217;s gotta be nice. Yeah, definitely. Balance [00:23:00] with, okay. We still wanted to pay , you know, make money.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Yeah. We don&#8217;t want to just spend it on a research project.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Brandon Dove:</strong> Yeah. That tracking is important too, right? Like, whatever time you&#8217;re spending on it, you wanna make sure it&#8217;s, it&#8217;s effective. You know, just like as a developer, if you&#8217;re building a new feature, you wanna make sure it&#8217;s not impacting the performance of the plugin, things like that.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So you gotta, you gotta weigh those things for sure.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Cory Miller:</strong> Yeah. And just there, it just kind of ping my thing so you. hours you all spend as a company on the product. Yep. That&#8217;s excellent. Because then you&#8217;re able to make better informed decisions. Okay, we just spent 50 or 500 hours this quarter, year, whatever it is, right?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In making those decisions, having some of the data. That&#8217;s awesome. Mm-hmm. . See, I like talking to the real agency pros, ,</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Brandon Dove:</strong> You gotta know.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Cory Miller:</strong> Yep. That&#8217;s true. All right, Brandon. Well thanks for, um, talking about all this. Is there anything that I missed that you want to. And talk about with the plugin and,</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Brandon Dove:</strong> um, no, I think, I think [00:24:00] that&#8217;s, that&#8217;s most of it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>You know, I, I think, you know, we&#8217;re, we&#8217;re not going anywhere. That&#8217;s, that&#8217;s, uh, um, you know, when development slows, sometimes people get like, is this plugin still active? Like, yeah, we&#8217;re, we&#8217;re still grinding on this and, and we don&#8217;t anticipate it going anywhere. There&#8217;s a lot of other advertising plugins out there.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>and, um, you know, I still think that that, you know, I, I&#8217;m personally biased, but I still think ours is the best. Mm-hmm. . Um, so we&#8217;re, we&#8217;re gonna continue to, to keep up with what, what WordPress is doing and make sure that it&#8217;s, it&#8217;s doing what we can for our customers to be successful.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Cory Miller:</strong> Cool. Well, I know you&#8217;re in Post Status , but where can we find Ad Sandy and learn more about you and Pixel Jar ?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Brandon Dove:</strong> Yeah, ad sanity plugin.com is the website. Um, and uh, from there you can get over to pixeljar.com as well. But, um, yeah, all the information&#8217;s on ad sanity plugin.com. Our, our socials are, you know, burning cuz of Twitter. I don&#8217;t know , uh, but uh, yeah, we&#8217;re [00:25:00] on, we&#8217;re on twitter at adsanityplugin.com (???) and Facebook as well, so wherever you still hang out.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Yeah. ,</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Cory Miller:</strong> we&#8217;ll be there. Yeah, exactly. All right. Thanks Brandon for sharing about Ed Sandy in our Product People series at Post Status draft. We&#8217;ll see you all next time.

This is the team&#8217;s first block theme on WordPress.org and it is a strong debut.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Lemmony is a beautifully-designed multipurpose theme that would work well for businesses, agencies, and portfolio websites. It features the Plus Jakarta Sans font face for both headings and paragraph text, a geometric sans serif style, designed by Gumpita Rahayu from Tokotype.</p>\n\n\n\n<img />\n\n\n\n<p>The homepage includes bold, full-width immersive images offset with calls-to-action and blocks featuring a variety of different ways to present information. Scrolling the page reveals tasteful (and optional) animation that brings the content to life. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Lemmony packages more than 30 custom block patterns to help users design and build pages. These include multiple heroes with lists and calls-to-action, heroes with images and titles, partner logos, query with a sidebar, services grid, services with video, team members, and more &#8211; nearly every kind of pattern that a business website might require.</p>\n\n\n\n<img />\n\n\n\n<p>Lemmony also packages five full-page patterns for services, gallery, contact, about, and the front page, making it easy to simply drop the pattern in place for the most common pages found on a brochure website. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>This theme offers a solid user experience for those who are just getting started building their websites. After installing and activating Lemmony on a fresh site, it will look nearly exactly like the <a href=\"https://lemmony.shufflehound.com/\">live demo</a>. Everything on the front page is in place with placeholder content, including different menu items, just waiting for the user to add, remove, or edit the blocks. The user doesn&#8217;t have to start from scratch do any guesswork about where things go in the design. This is the kind of experience that all block themes should provide.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Lemmony comes with a companion plugin that includes additional customer blocks and other features, such as the custom icons seen in the demo. It will prompt the user after installing the theme to install the plugin as well to get more features. If the user is editing a page and inserts a pattern that includes icons, the theme will allow users to install the plugin directly from the editor. It&#8217;s a very smooth experience for including features that require an additional plugin. The plugin is optional and most of the designs seen in the demo work without it installed. </p>\n\n\n\n<img />\n\n\n\n<p>In the future, Lemmony&#8217;s creators plan to include more website templates, which would make it easier and faster to set up different kinds of sites. Overall, the theme feels snappy, has an unusually large variety of patterns, and is responsive and looks great on mobile. The installation experience is user-friendly and provides a good starting point for jumping into full-site editing.

The new button allows readers to click an icon to launch a sharing window that will ask the user to enter the full URL of the Mastodon instance where they want to share the post.</p>\n\n\n\n<img />\n\n\n\n<p>Adding the URL will update the window to automatically insert the link for the post and share from your account. </p>\n\n\n\n<img />\n\n\n\n<p>Mastodon makes its <a href=\"https://api.joinmastodon.org/statistics\">usage numbers</a> publicly accessible. As of March 8, 2023, the total user count is at 6,487,821, with 1,293,309 considered active users. Many WordPress community members who have moved over to Mastodon report having more quality interactions and higher engagement than on other social media platforms. This new sharing button gives your posts more opportunities to reach that audience. It can be enabled at Jetpack > Settings > Sharing in the admin.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Jetpack team is also looking at <a href=\"https://github.com/Automattic/jetpack/issues/7790\">adding Mastodon support to Publicize</a> so users can have their posts automatically shared when they are published. Many people have requested this feature on GitHub and it may land in the plugin sometime in the future.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Jetpack 11.9 also updates the design of the Stats dashboard. In place of the dusty blue bar graphs and sections with referrers and top pages and posts, the updated design is now more in line with Jetpack&#8217;s green branding.

My name is Nathan Wrigley. Jukebox is a podcast which is dedicated to all things WordPress. The people, the events, the plugins, the blocks, the themes, and in this case, enabling people to contribute to WordPress.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you&#8217;d like to subscribe to the podcast, you can do that by searching for WP Tavern in your podcast player of choice. Or go to WPTavern.com forward slash feed forward slash podcast. And you can copy that URL into most podcast players.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you have a topic that you&#8217;d like us to feature on the podcast, I&#8217;m keen to hear from you, and hopefully get you all your idea featured on the show. Had to WPTavern.com forward slash contact forward slash jukebox, and use the form there.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So on the podcast today, we have Sé Reed and Courtney Robertson, and they&#8217;re here to talk about the WP Community Collective, or WPCC for short. In a nutshell, the WPCC is a nonprofit that is hoping to fund contributors to the WordPress project.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It&#8217;s been said before, but I&#8217;ll say it again, people who can afford to contribute to the WordPress project are the people who can literally afford to contribute to WordPress.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This sounds obvious, but think about it for a moment. Most of us know WordPress is built on top of a dedicated base of volunteers. People give up their time and expertise to contribute towards the project, and in this way, make it free to download and use. But we all have to earn money at some point. Most are not in a position to donate their time completely freely. They have to put food on the table.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Often contributors are sponsored by the companies that they work for, either part-time or full-time. There&#8217;s nothing wrong with this model, but what about the capable, willing volunteers who are not in this position? The people who have the skills and motivation to contribute, but not the time or finances to make that a reality.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The WPCC wants to act as a go-between for companies or organizations who are willing to spend money improving WordPress, and the individuals who can implement those improvements.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This enterprise will be done via the WPCC fellowships. A fellowship in a specific area of WordPress is created, for example, an accessibility fellowship. People apply for that fellowship, and if successful, get the finances they need to take on the work.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This means that individuals don&#8217;t need to be working for an organization, which funds them directly, and the organizations which wish to contribute don&#8217;t need to fund only their own team members.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We talk about where the WPCC is at with their fellowships, and how it&#8217;s set up so that all participants are fully aware of where the money is being invested.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you&#8217;re from a company who would like to assist contributors to WordPress, or an individual wishing to get involved, this episode is for you.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you&#8217;re interested in finding out more, you can find all of the links in the show notes by heading to WPTavern.com forward slash podcast, where you&#8217;ll find all the other episodes as well.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And so without further delay, I bring you Sé Reed and Courtney Robertson.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I am joined on the podcast today by two wonderful people. I have Sé Reed and Courtney Robertson. Hello, both of you.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:04:21] Sé Reed: Hi. Thanks for having us.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:04:22] Courtney Robertson: Hey, Nathan.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:04:23] Nathan Wrigley: Hello. Hello, hello. Well, welcome. We&#8217;re going to get into the meat and the bones of this subject today. We&#8217;re going to be talking about the WP Community Collective. I confess at the outset of this episode that I am going to be schooled. Most of the questions that I&#8217;m going to ask are from a point of view of ignorance, so forgive me. You&#8217;re going to educate me hopefully on this subject and we&#8217;ll learn together.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But first of all, just to orientate the listeners. I wonder if in turn, shall we start with Sé? Just a quick little potted history of who you are and how you&#8217;ve come to be in the WordPress space.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:04:56] Sé Reed: I&#8217;ve been using and building WordPress websites since 2007, which is wild to me because that&#8217;s, I think that&#8217;s 15, 16 years. I&#8217;ve been doing a WordPress podcast called WP Water Cooler since 2012. That is 10 years. And I have been part of the community, speaking at WordCamps, organizing WordCamps for I think also since 2012.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I fell in love with WordCamps at WordCamp Phoenix. I live in California, but I went to Phoenix and just absolutely fell in love as people do with the WordPress community mostly. I already loved the software. But yeah, I&#8217;ve been part of it ever since. I took a little break to have a kid and then Courtney here brought me right back into the fold. So blame her. It&#8217;s her fault.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:05:47] Nathan Wrigley: That seems like a perfect segue. That&#8217;s lovely. Thank you. And, let&#8217;s then segue to Courtney. Tell us about yourself.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:05:55] Courtney Robertson: Hey there. So I have been in the WordPress community since, well, I started using the software I believe in 2005. It would be around version 2.5. Started contributing by checking guests in at WordCamp Mid-Atlantic in 2009, and joined the training team, thus beginning my actual team contributions. In 2014 have had several stints of being the training team co rep. And at this time, you could still find me within the training team as a WordPress faculty member. And when I&#8217;m not doing all of those wonderful things, I am a developer advocate at GoDaddy Pro, and a lot of that work involves working with the open source and specifically WordPress communities.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:06:42] Nathan Wrigley: Wow. Really deep and rich, both of you.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:06:44] Sé Reed: I forgot to say what I do, now. It&#8217;s all about the past. I was like, oh yeah, the present</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:06:49] Nathan Wrigley: Well tell us.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:06:50] Sé Reed: Courtney reminded me with her awesome contribution. I just took on a co-team rep role as well on the make marketing team, for 2023. So that&#8217;s exciting. In my day job I have my own company and I build websites for people and do digital strategy of all kinds.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:07:09] Nathan Wrigley: I&#8217;m often in awe about how many different roles there are in the WordPress community. I remember when I first stumbled across the software, I just viewed it as exactly that. It was a piece of software. So this is going back probably to 20, I don&#8217;t know, 2014, 2015, something like that.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And then it very quickly became apparent that there was an awful lot going on with the community. Much more than I&#8217;d anticipated. And fast forward to today, 2023. I mean it has more or less taken over my, my entire life. It is more or less everything that I do.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:07:38] Sé Reed: We can relate to that.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:07:40] Nathan Wrigley: Right. Yes. So we&#8217;re all in good company. We&#8217;ve given ourselves up to WordPress.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:07:44] Sé Reed: To an ethos, I think, is really what it is. I think that&#8217;s part of what draws the community together. You didn&#8217;t ask, but I&#8217;m going to answer it anyway. I think that&#8217;s really what, that ethos and the being part of something bigger. Whether it&#8217;s open source or the community or just spreading the goodness of easy to use software. I really think that&#8217;s what makes it different.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:08:05] Nathan Wrigley: Yeah. Somebody was saying to me the other day about their conversations that they&#8217;ve been having with people about ceasing to use WordPress as their CMS of choice. But the glue which has kept them in it is the community. It&#8217;s that piece which has actually kept them going with the software. So in a strange sense the community has trumped the software in that instance.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:08:28] Sé Reed: That&#8217;s so true. I think that a lot of people stay in WordPress and WordPress has had such a, well, 20 years, this is its 20th anniversary year. So it&#8217;s had that success. I truly believe because of the community and because of the, really the stewardship that&#8217;s happened within the community. And again that ethos of drawing people together and, really just feeling like there&#8217;s a sense of, sort of a sense of ownership I think over, or at least stake in the community and stake in the software. It feels like we all have a part of it. I think that that&#8217;s, it&#8217;s something really special. It doesn&#8217;t exist even in other open source communities to the same degree.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:09:10] Nathan Wrigley: Yeah, it is constantly remarkable to me that that is such an important piece, and it&#8217;s so ephemeral. I can&#8217;t quite get my hands on it. I don&#8217;t really understand what that thing is, but there is a thing there.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:09:21] Sé Reed: Exactly.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:09:22] Nathan Wrigley: And, it&#8217;s wonderful and it, it&#8217;s gathered us together today to have a chat. You&#8217;ve recently got involved with something that, I&#8217;m going to pronounce it once. I&#8217;m going to say it once at the beginning and then I&#8217;m going to truncate it. So from the start we&#8217;re going to be talking about the WP Community Collective, so the WordPress Community Collective. But I&#8217;m probably either going to call it the community collective or just collective, because it&#8217;s going to be a whole lot easier.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:09:44] Sé Reed: Yeah. I didn&#8217;t think about WPCC being hard to say in a British accent, but.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:09:48] Nathan Wrigley: No, it&#8217;s funny, isn&#8217;t it? But that acronym somehow completely gets stuck on the end of my tongue before it escapes my mouth. What is it? I don&#8217;t mind which of you want to take it on? What is it? How did it come about? Broadly, in broad brush strokes, and then we can get into the detail. What&#8217;s the point of this?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:10:04] Sé Reed: What&#8217;s the point? That&#8217;s a great question, Nathan. I&#8217;ll take it, just to give the broad strokes. What the WP Community Collective is, is essentially it&#8217;s a non-profit project that allows, we are in the process of funding contributors to the WordPress project. So people who are working on the make teams and the open source WordPress software, that&#8217;s who we&#8217;re going to be, who we are supporting.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And, it&#8217;s really a way to bring together the community to allow us to fund and support the contributors who are doing so much work to keep this software slash community slash lifestyle going, moving forward and growing and responding to the needs of the community and technology. So really it&#8217;s about supporting the contributors that make up the community.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:11:06] Nathan Wrigley: So you mentioned two things there. You mentioned funding, and obviously that&#8217;s a key component of it, but you also mentioned more the community side of things. Being there as a supportive hand. Are they two distinct parts or is it all about the funding? Is that primarily what it&#8217;s about, or is it also about being a friendly face?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:11:25] Sé Reed: We&#8217;re trying not to be, we are, and we&#8217;ll continue to try to not be US focused. That&#8217;s something that happens a lot. That kind of defaults to that when we&#8217;re here. But, in America, the way that we like to show our support is with money.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>That&#8217;s a thing. You know we tip people. That&#8217;s sort of how we demonstrate that we like a thing. So not trying to bring that ethos necessarily into the greater world, but primarily we mean funding. So primarily we mean sponsoring people to do contribution of various types.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But we also have goals to basically be like a third space to have conversations about WordPress and the WordPress community and the ecosystem adjacent to the WordPress project. So, you know, all of the plug-ins and the themes and the assemblers and all of that world, the marketers. So, we want to provide a space to integrate all of that. But that&#8217;s more of just soft support. Really what it does come down to is funding support.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:12:36] Nathan Wrigley: Okay. Given that you&#8217;ve set up this WP Community Collective, and usually when something like this is set up, there&#8217;s a problem to be solved. There&#8217;s something that is identified as could be better. Let&#8217;s all gather around and figure out how we can do it. So, essentially what is the problem around the community?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>What are the problems that people are facing? Is it one simply that people who would willingly contribute their time simply can&#8217;t afford to do it? We often hear this mentioned that, you know, those who can afford to contribute are the ones who can afford to contribute, because they live in a certain part of the world. They may be fully employed so they can dedicate something. Perhaps their company is kind enough to, give them a day, a week or half a day, whatever it may be. They&#8217;re seconded in some way so they can contribute to the project. But there&#8217;s a whole ton of people, hundreds of people who would love to be in that position. But the financial component is the barrier. It&#8217;s the wall that&#8217;s stopping them being able to contribute.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:13:33] Sé Reed: Yeah, at the end of the day there&#8217;s really two sides of this. And, one side is how can people effectively and consistently and meaningfully participate in the project if they can&#8217;t consistently show up? You know, so much happens every day in the WordPress make channels on the P2s, on the blogs. There&#8217;s a lot going on, and there are a lot of people moving the project forward and even just paying attention and keeping tabs on all of the new stuff that&#8217;s happening is kind of a full-time job.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So really, what ends up happening is that the folks who are in leadership roles tend to be sponsored contributors. And I say leadership roles, whether that&#8217;s a team rep role, which is, it&#8217;s leadership, but it&#8217;s not like authority leadership. But, just by showing up consistently and responding to things and being there every day, which you can do if you are paid to do so, that gives you, I don&#8217;t want to use the word clout, but it gives you, I&#8217;m not really sure what the word is. When we talk about it being a meritocracy, right?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you do things, then you have influence, and people want to do more, but only the people who are really supported financially to be able to do that. Or like you said, have the means in some other way, have the ability to consistently show up in that meritocracy. And so in a way, by default, we&#8217;re really the leadership and the ongoing constant push forward really does tend to be from the sponsored side of the contributor pool, let&#8217;s say. And everyone else tends to just be catching up or lending their opinion in different places.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So, that&#8217;s one of the reasons, is we want to be able to have folks contribute and contribute consistently, and contribute in a meaningful way to parts of the project that are maybe not getting as much of attention or need more attention, like accessibility. And so we&#8217;re really trying to find a way to support those people, and bring the community together to support those people. And really, Courtney can talk a little bit about the problems that, it&#8217;s not just that individuals have problems finding support, it&#8217;s that the people who want to support have problems funding the individuals. So Courtney, do you want to talk to that, about that a little bit?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:16:05] Courtney Robertson: So for context, I shared that I had started contributing in 2009, and for a number of years, in fact, up until a year and a half ago, I was not sponsored. I wouldn&#8217;t even say I was self sponsored financially. But I contributed. In fact, I was the person couch surfing at a WordCamp US on my college roommate&#8217;s couch, and driving quite a distance in, and could, at the time, barely scrape together the funds to take care of my parking.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So I know what that experience has been like and to still want to contribute and to still feel that this is part of my work, my role. And I undoubtedly benefited from all of the hardships of my past. I&#8217;ve had some medical challenges, some other life things, you know, as people do. And without that experience, I certainly wouldn&#8217;t be involved in WPCC. I wouldn&#8217;t have gotten to the job that I have now at GoDaddy Pro. There&#8217;s just a lot of reasons for seeing from that perspective that I think has really benefited.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So from the person that is seeking to be sponsored in some capacity, I&#8217;ll say what I did, very publicly. I was teaching at the time, I loved it, but I felt like my higher purpose was to do more of the work on Learn to be able to create this content that could be a multiplier effect to impact that many more students, that many more learners than the current job that I had had.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And in order to do that, I started to let some folks know. And I went to my now manager and said, if GoDaddy ever has a role open up where I could be contributing to the training team as part of my work time, Adam Warner, please keep me in mind for that. And in fact, he did. Now, that doesn&#8217;t mean that everybody has the gumption to go out and start approaching folks and say, I would like to receive.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I appreciate those that have spoken up and let folks like Sé and I know. We&#8217;re working on some processes to sort of collect that information. Who&#8217;s already contributing that would like to contribute at a higher capacity? We have some contributors that I know of in our WordPress community that said, I would like to be sponsored. For instance, Joe Dolson says, I would like to be sponsored at $500 US a month to contribute this certain amount to accessibility purposes. Other than that, I&#8217;m tied up with clients. And then increasingly grew that over time.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But still that process, it doesn&#8217;t matter who you are or where you&#8217;re from. That process of saying, I want to do this takes a certain amount of navigating, what can be perceived as awkward because you&#8217;re expecting handouts, but at the same time you are a professional and you bring professional caliber qualities to the work that you do for this open source project that is used by 43% of the internet.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So yes, there is a reason that contributors should be funded. We definitely know this and that pathway of letting folks know can be awkward and challenging. And then the pathway from those that have the funds to do the sponsoring, whether you are an individual or a company, both perspectives of this get a little tricky.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So from an individual&#8217;s perspective, there are those if you look through the WPCCs sponsors so far, we&#8217;ve raised all of our funds essentially through individuals at this time. And that&#8217;s several thousand US dollars. So that&#8217;s just coming in from individuals who said, yes, this matters. Yes, we want to fund what&#8217;s going on in the work.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And so it takes a lot of people, that are individual people, giving a little bit to reach that kind of a goal. And then from a company&#8217;s perspective, a lot of companies struggle too, how to fund the work of open source. And recently I&#8217;ve been researching in and getting into this more deeply, and it&#8217;s not just about the WordPress community, but just how does whether you are an individual, small business company, and I see some really great ones that are doing this.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>JB over in the Core team is part of about a two dozen staff member agency based out of France. And all of their staff are contributors. And I think it&#8217;s amazing that companies who done it. So, great work on them. But other organizations, whether you&#8217;re a small business, you may not quite know how, well, how do I manage, how do I, if I&#8217;m contributing, what do I get? Is it just I&#8217;m contributing in a charitable way and I don&#8217;t have much attachment to the work that the person does? How do I know that what I&#8217;m contributing to has any payoff for, not just the goodwill of my company, right? That&#8217;s a marketing approach, but also that the people receiving it are actually doing something productive with it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Should there be accountability in all of that? When you get into larger size organizations like my employer, we&#8217;re not structured in a way, we&#8217;re a publicly held company. We&#8217;re not structured in a way that has a whole staff of who&#8217;s overseeing the work of those that we are sponsoring.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>GoDaddy does have two full-time people that are essentially staff that we sponsor to work on WordPress. We ambitiously would like to keep growing that, but there are challenges. So when it comes to GoDaddy related to WPCC, I&#8217;m really excited that we&#8217;re in the conversations right now of getting that money flowing a bit more.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I can&#8217;t make any promises from GoDaddy&#8217;s side of as to what all that would look like, but what I can absolutely say is that we know it&#8217;s a real need. We know that the WordPress community will greatly benefit from this. But as it would turn out, a large company like this can&#8217;t just go making purchases from any kind of business or giving money to any kind of organization.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:21:27] Sé Reed: Shareholders don&#8217;t like it when you just randomly give money to people.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:21:30] Courtney Robertson: No, they don&#8217;t.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:21:32] Sé Reed: They don&#8217;t.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:21:32] Courtney Robertson: Oh, there are so many stories that I could say. But, to that end, what I for sure am happy to say though is that we&#8217;re working together in a way that will do all of the red tape that a company would need, to get that approved and cleared so that those funds can start flowing. And, so I&#8217;m really excited about it from that side because you know what? GoDaddy can&#8217;t just stuff a bunch of bills in an envelope and mail it out to someone. They have to actually have a strategy when it comes down to why are we doing this? What&#8217;s the outcome? What&#8217;s the, the ROI, right, of these things?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And investing in the software that powers 43% of the internet, that many of our customers are using. Well that sounds like we have a good reason to be investing in that. So it makes it quite interesting to navigate those challenges. From an internal perspective, I encourage folks at other corporations, if you&#8217;re facing those challenges, to reach out to me and I&#8217;d be happy to have some private conversations with you about what specific challenges you might be facing.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:22:34] Sé Reed: And how the WPCC.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:22:36] Courtney Robertson: Yes, can help with that.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:22:38] Nathan Wrigley: Courtney, there was loads in there, and I just want to drill down a little bit on you personally, if you don&#8217;t mind, because I find that quite an interesting dialogue. You used the word gumption there, which I thought was quite interesting. And, it sounds like you&#8217;re very self-reliant. You are driven, and it sounds like you just kept banging on doors and fighting the good fight and keeping going, and eventually that paid off. But I&#8217;m guessing that there were times during the period where it wasn&#8217;t paying off, where you must have looked at yourself and thought, what the heck am I doing?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And I guess that&#8217;s the person that is going to benefit from this, the person who knows that they want to contribute, but really has maybe been trying, struggling, doesn&#8217;t have a way through, doesn&#8217;t have a pathway through. And we don&#8217;t want those people to be disappointed and turned away.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:23:22] Courtney Robertson: Correct. Yeah, so for a number of years, in fact I took a hiatus. I had little kids and I had a set amount of hours available in my day, and I worked for a WordPress plugin company that I loved that experience. But I worked during only their nap time schedule. So, I didn&#8217;t have time to contribute or even keep up with the quantity of information that was happening on WordPress. And that was all during the lead up to and release of Gutenberg. So, it was a hard time to be missing all of that information.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But I will say that there are a wealth of contributors in our community that if they had that financial backing would have a better quality of life, be able to contribute that much more because they could let go of their other income sources as an offset.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So I had started to let the previous employers, I worked for two other WordPress organizations previously, and I started to let them know that I would like to be involved more in WordPress, and the work happening there. And they didn&#8217;t have that capacity built into their business models, right. And so I felt that by approaching somebody like GoDaddy, I knew that they had a couple of contributors, and this was more of a, the role that I am in affords me some time. I am not full-time sponsored to WordPress. But it affords me quite a bit of time and it is vital to the job that I do to be a contributor, if that makes sense?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:24:53] Nathan Wrigley: Yeah. That&#8217;s really, really interesting.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:24:55] Sé Reed: I was going to say that that&#8217;s the, it&#8217;s exactly that dilemma that even Courtney, who is literally representing open source and doing massive WordPress contribution with her company. Even her job is not a hundred percent WordPress. And that&#8217;s part of it because there&#8217;s a need for contribution.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I don&#8217;t know, we really have clarified that part, but like the contribution has, because of covid, because of the lack of WordCamps or whatnot, did definitely take a dive. And also there are so many other CMSs and worlds out there that it&#8217;s not just inevitable that WordPress is going to continue to have a healthy community and continue to grow and continue to be the CMS and the software that we all know and love.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>That&#8217;s not a given in the world of actual capitalism that we live in and whatnot. So if we want it to be around, if we want to support it, then we need to find ways to connect the resources that are there with the efforts that can be made on the ground. And making that connection between companies that have budgets, but don&#8217;t have the ability to hire people. That is really, I think the, well, it&#8217;s not just for companies, but that&#8217;s really the key element for the WPCC.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Because we know there are lots of resources out there. There&#8217;s lots of agencies, there&#8217;s lots of businesses that have some funds, you know, they&#8217;re making revenue off of their various products or their services. But they can&#8217;t say maybe giving five hours a month or something isn&#8217;t even that productive for them. But if they were able to take their money and combine that with other folks who are also in the same situation, then they can help fund someone who is able to put that focus in.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And also a big part of what we&#8217;re doing is making sure that those fellows are talking about what it is they&#8217;re doing. The challenges that they&#8217;re facing. So bringing the information also back out into the community, so it&#8217;s not just a you&#8217;re putting money in and you know, you never know what happens to that, right?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Our fellows will be responding, or blogging actually, on the website telling us what they&#8217;re doing. Telling us what&#8217;s going on in the project and, so folks who are putting their funds into the WPCC are combining their money to make it more effective, but also doing it in a way that gives them a say in it. Not necessarily a say in it, but like a part of it. They get to participate in it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>They are also part of the community collective. So it is all, all of us working together. So it&#8217;s really just about allocating resources and, available energy really. We&#8217;re just putting resources and energy together and combining them and helping to move the project forward.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:27:56] Nathan Wrigley: Yeah, so essentially it feels to me, I mean I may be parsing this wrong, but it feels like you are acting as a conduit. You are the bridge between the people who have money, let&#8217;s say for want of a better word, finances. But they don&#8217;t necessarily know where those finances would best go. So they come to you, deposit it there in the collective, and then your job is to make decisions about who would be the best steward of that money.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And then get them to do whatever it is that you&#8217;ve agreed to do and then report back to the sponsors in the form of blogging or what have you, so that they&#8217;ve got some way of, well, I guess the word is, sort of oversight really. They&#8217;ve got a little bit of oversight and they can see that their money hasn&#8217;t in fact just been squandered. And so it&#8217;s a really neat little idea.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:28:45] Sé Reed: Thanks, we like it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:28:47] Nathan Wrigley: Yeah, yeah. The thing that interests me is, as soon as you get involved with money, and you alluded to this earlier, you know. The government, they don&#8217;t like to have people just willy nilly spraying money all over the place. And so if companies are giving you money, presumably they want to know that it&#8217;s being marshaled correctly, you know. It&#8217;s not being squandered. It&#8217;s being used effectively in ways that perhaps align with a brand that they&#8217;ve got, you know, it maybe that they want it to go in a particular direction. They might be more interested in accessibility than others. Others might be more into, I don&#8217;t know, we could invent a thousand different other categories. How does that all get figured out? In other words what are the kind of roles that you are giving people who are taking on the work that you are paying them for?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:29:30] Sé Reed: That&#8217;s a great question. We are starting with accessibility, because it is so clearly a need, and it is also very, very underfunded in terms of sponsored contributors. We&#8217;ll be launching, I keep pushing the date on this, but we&#8217;re going to be launching our first, or announcing who our first fellow is shortly, for our accessibility fellowship. The goal is to fund that person for five hours a week for a minimum of six months.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Normally we would fund the entire fellowship prior to launching it, or starting with the person. We would fund the fellowship first. But in this case, we wanted to start with a fellowship that we already knew was really important. And so we created the accessibility fellowship first.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>That&#8217;s really our initial goal is to get that funded. So we are working with some additional partners to develop partnership fellowships. And essentially those, it&#8217;s in a way, it&#8217;s like a scholarship, right? A fellowship is very much like a scholarship. We&#8217;ll have an application process for folks to apply to be fellows, and then different fellowships will have different focuses. So we are scoping out currently, like I said, accessibility fellowships, but also some Core fellowships. And not just Core in terms of development, but also Core in terms of communication.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:30:51] Courtney Robertson: I&#8217;d like to elaborate a little bit on what Sé was saying there is that, as part of all of this, we have so many roles across different teams. Whether you are in Core because you&#8217;re a developer or because you can help wrangle the information that the Core team needs to function as a team, to share externally.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Over in other teams we need some assets like project management. In other teams, we need areas like project management skills. Accessibility could relate to the accessibility of the software, but it could just as easily relate to the accessibility of the learn.wordpress.org content, and or site functionality. So you could see how there are different roles beyond what we normally envision for the different teams that relate to just keeping the whole project up and running. And we&#8217;re pretty aware of that.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Likewise, being able to get to your nearest international camp and or a couple of very local regional camps might be important. Or ongoing professional development in your areas. So those are all skills and assets and resources that come to our mind because we have been both contributors into the WordPress project for quite a while.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Additionally, if I were to ask folks how to get involved in the WPCC, there are a few ways to do so. Any person is welcome to come be a member. So we have memberships available, anyone can be a member. Ideally that would come with a few funds towards those that are contributors. But we welcome members to just come and join. And the show notes will link you over to our website, and from there you can follow it out to the opencollective.com/thewpcc.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We also welcome sponsorships. Sponsorships, again would look like those that would like to sponsor a specific initiative. So if we have a very specific fellowship that you would like to help fund, you can choose to come along and be a part of that.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And then we also have areas for partnerships. And that&#8217;s the area that, one of the areas that, my employer is starting to look at is partnerships. So perhaps they would like to kick off a specific fellowship, right? There might be general fellowships that the WPCC declares and says, the WPCC needs to, sees that we need to work on accessibility. So we&#8217;re going to launch one of those.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But what if there were specific fellowships available based upon different companies in the industry, right? And so if you would like to set up a specific partnership to drive a specific initiative, that&#8217;s definitely an option available as well That could also look like partnering with other WordPress organizations to help fund initiatives that we&#8217;ve seen already.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I loved for WordCamp US the amount of organizations that pulled resources together to increase diverse speakers at organizations. To increase diverse speakers to attend and speak at WordCamp US. So we can partner with lots of different organizations. We hope to be announcing some of those partnerships in the not too distant future to really benefit what the work of the WordPress community is and what that can look like.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:33:56] Nathan Wrigley: So the next question I&#8217;ve got is, Courtney just then mentioned that happy to have people come along and if they bring finance with them, that&#8217;s very, very welcome. But let&#8217;s say that I come along and it&#8217;s my company, or it&#8217;s me and we just bring a modest amount of money. You know, I&#8217;m not a giant entity. I&#8217;ve got $500, a thousand dollars, whatever it may be. Do I have sort of any say in where that ends up? Or is it more a case of just trust us on this one? We&#8217;ll publish some documentation about where the money&#8217;s being spent? Where do we stand with that?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:34:30] Sé Reed: Well, the organization that we are fiscally hosted through, is a, it&#8217;s a payment system essentially, with nonprofit sponsorship that allows us to take in funds and spend funds and the entire budget, every dollar that goes in or out of the WPCC is documented and on the website for everyone to see. So everyone can see exactly where all of the money is going in terms of accountability.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But in terms of participatory, or just influence or whatnot. We&#8217;re actually in the process of working on our bylaws, but our rough outline for this is essentially that we have a membership and you can join for free, or you can join at a membership payment level annually, if you want to support that way.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And we&#8217;re working out the exact guidelines for voting and that sort of a thing. We want to base it on, have you contributed in the last year, or we&#8217;re working on those types of criteria. But essentially the membership will be able to, first of all talk to us, which is not just talk to us, but talk to the board. But we&#8217;ll also be part of the decision making process. Not on a individual, specific, fellowship level, but on a what do we focus on level.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And also for the larger projects that we want to take on, the community will be, or the membership will be involved in that as well. So, a company cannot be a member because we don&#8217;t believe in Citizens United in our organization, which is a Supreme Court ruling that said corporations are people here in the US. So it&#8217;s only individuals who are going to be able to participate as members.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Like I said, that will be more of a let&#8217;s figure out what needs to be funded. Do we want to worry about old bugs in the system, or do we want to fund accessibility, or do we want to really have a push to the re-envisioning of the media manager, for example. The media library. So, the community, the membership will have a say in that type of way. It won&#8217;t be that the community, the membership is voting on every single action that is taken. Because that would become a bureaucratic nightmare.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But in terms of direction and goals and partnerships and strategy, the membership can and will be an active part of that conversation. So our goal is to really be transparent and also be a, sort of a incubator for those conversations about funding. About project priorities that aren&#8217;t just the make project priorities. Because there are also important components that affect the rest of the ecosystem, like PHP 8, for example. And the push, the development push, that&#8217;s needed to get things ready for that. Like that&#8217;s something that&#8217;s definitely been important to the community, but has not necessarily gotten as much traction in Core as some people would like. So there&#8217;s all sorts of different issues like that that can be given attention and brought to the surface, and hopefully, we all just can move forward, move the project forward, more.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:37:47] Nathan Wrigley: Can I ask in terms of the fellowships and who receives the fellowships? So how will that work? So let&#8217;s say, for example, I would like to contribute my time into some area, and I notice on the website at the time that I&#8217;m looking that I fit the bill. I would like to help in that way. Is it kind of like a job application process, where I fill out a form and some panel that I may be speaking to, or may do it without the need for my attendance.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Do they decide who it&#8217;s going to be? Because obviously there&#8217;s concerns there about things like favoritism, or whether the correct person gets the job. But also concerns about weighting things so that people who perhaps, how to describe this, people who currently really would struggle to be able to contribute, maybe they get some leg up if you like. There&#8217;s a little bit more weight for certain individuals than others for the circumstances in which they find themselves. So just questions around that really.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:38:44] Sé Reed: It&#8217;s going to be more like, rather than a job application, more like a scholarship. And that&#8217;s really what fellowships, that that kind of fellowship structure is really why we chose that. Because, it&#8217;s not a permanent position. It&#8217;s a temporary position, six months, a year, two years, depending on what we, you know, are tackling. Maybe even three months for short term contribution if that needs to happen.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But, basically it&#8217;ll be, we will create the fellowships and identify the need, and then open applications for people to apply for the fellowship. And then we will evaluate those applications and select fellows. So essentially it&#8217;s very much like a scholarship or, I would like to think less like a job interview.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:39:26] Nathan Wrigley: So given everything that Sé just said about the way that you are going to be giving out these fellowships, and the way that they&#8217;re going to be distributed. Given that there&#8217;s a lot of work on the sponsorship side, there&#8217;s a lot of work on the people who are getting these fellowships as well.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>There must be a lot of work being done by you and the people in the organization. So how is that funded? Is there a certain proportion of the finance that goes through the WPCC that is taken for administrative tasks and so on? Or is this an entirely nonprofit? I think in the US you call it a 501C3?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:40:04] Courtney Robertson: Yeah, so there are a few ways of the funds coming in. It is an option, strong option to go through the nonprofit direction. There is a total of 15% overhead that we need to take care of. Some of that goes to the direct operating costs of the WPCC. And to be clear, that doesn&#8217;t fund Sé, Katie or I, who are the current board members, personally. That just goes to the operating expenses of the WPCC.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Also, there is a fee in addition to that, that goes through Open Collective because they are the payment processor. They are the way that makes it possible for us to see all of these financial transactions. This is an organization that is set up specifically for open source initiatives, and they provide that oversight. That means we don&#8217;t have to go get a bank account. We don&#8217;t have to go set up a non-profit organization. We don&#8217;t have to do all of those extra things because Open Collective provides that for us and many others. So they do take a small portion of the funds that come through.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And the remaining amount goes directly to those that are doing the work. At this time, because we are the three that stepped in together and said, let&#8217;s launch this thing, we are the board. Over the next year you&#8217;ll start receiving some more announcements and information about putting together a more complete board. That board will always hold a seat for the executive director of the project, whomever that shall be. So that&#8217;s definitely going to be one board member, optionally, additionally added.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But in addition to that, we will be looking for those to become board members over the next several years. This first year out, we just thought, you know, we just need to launch this thing and get some traction going. Let&#8217;s get some action happening.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:41:53] Nathan Wrigley: Yeah. This may sound like an incredibly cynical question, and I apologize if it is. Sometimes I get the feeling that companies when they do sponsorships and things like that, they like to proclaim, they like to advertise the fact because it&#8217;s good business. You know, they&#8217;ve done a good thing and they would like a little bit of recognition on the backside of that.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Is there anything in here like that for people who contribute? Say, for example, a company, they might get a badge or a sticker or some kind of way that they can say, look, in the year 2020, I contributed to this project and I&#8217;m proudly going to identify myself as such.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:42:30] Courtney Robertson: Sure. So first and foremost I&#8217;ll speak to, there are three different departments within my employer at GoDaddy, that each have varying reasons they would like to make use of funding contributors through the WPCC. Out of all of those, none of them are for self-interest. And I say this to be super clear to the community, yes, I am an employee. Yes, I have mentioned my employer many times in this episode. But it really is not about proclaiming, here we are, look at us.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I do though understand that there is a marketing advantage and so, I think it is worth people being aware of the good that does happen. That&#8217;s not the sole reason why it should be done, this work should continue. But for those to know who is helping make that work be possible, the WPCC will be able to set up fellowships with those partnership type of programs, those partnership initiatives, so that if some other organization would like to come along and say, we would like to start up a fellowship for an individual or for a group of individuals, and that being maybe a six month rotation.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And out of that, perhaps they later bring them on as staff as well. And so there is that piece, or that component as well, where the WPCC can be that entry point. Especially for organizations that don&#8217;t have the dedicated internals of managing and maintaining this. And they&#8217;re just beginning to explore what does it look like. Or they would like the contributors that are doing this as their job to be really thoroughly trained.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And also, all organizations that sponsor contributors, some of that information goes back to what that company does. For instance, I know that the work that George Mamadashvili does in Gutenberg really helps shape some of the internal information around how some of the themes and plugins that GoDaddy creates makes Gutenberg implementation possible for our customers, right?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And so, there&#8217;s a lot of value in this, and at no point would I ever slight that a company should be able to say, here is what we have contributed. Especially when many are looking at or watching, well, how do you contribute to WordPress as an organization, right? So those fellowships and the partnership programs will definitely be an option for that. As well, organizations can say, we are providing this amount of funding, and it could go into whatever bucket the WPCC would like to put it into.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:44:58] Nathan Wrigley: Hmm. I guess you&#8217;re on the first few steps of hopefully a long journey and a lot of these things are going to be ironed out and figured out over time.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:45:07] Courtney Robertson: Right.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:45:08] Nathan Wrigley: Courtney and Sé if somebody has been interested in what they&#8217;ve heard today and they would like to come to you and get some more information, where is the best place to find you? Let&#8217;s start with Courtney.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:45:20] Courtney Robertson: You could find me personally as courtneyr_dev on most of the social platforms. Sometimes that&#8217;s a hyphen. If you get lost, head to my personal website, courtneyr.dev. You could certainly find out about thewpcommunitycollective.com. That will get you the information that will take you across our website as well as across to the listing that we have with Open Collective, where you can actually put in your information.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:45:47] Nathan Wrigley: Thank you very much. Right, Sé. Where do we find information about you?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:45:51] Sé Reed: Well, the best thing to do is go join us on the thewpcommunitycollective.com. Connect to us by joining our organization. That&#8217;s the best way. But I am currently @sereed on mastodon.social. I&#8217;m on LinkedIn. I&#8217;m in the Slack channels. I&#8217;m in the Post Status channels. So if anyone wants to get a hold of me, probably Slack in the WordPress community is the best way. I still look at my Twitter DMs, even though I&#8217;m staunchly anti Twitter now, sadly. But I&#8217;m still there. I&#8217;m still around listening, so. I&#8217;m at sereedmedia on all the things, I&#8217;m around. There&#8217;s, I don&#8217;t know if there&#8217;s any other Sé Reeds either, but you know.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We really want to participate with the community. We really want to hear from the community. Have ideas, have suggestions, have comments. This is a community effort. This is a, a larger project than Courtney and myself. We&#8217;re trying to be anti gatekeepers. Taking influence from Courtney, who is an anti gatekeeper. We really want this to be a community project and a community organization. So please get involved. Connect with us. We want to hear from you.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:47:02] Nathan Wrigley: I will make to put all of the links in the show notes, so if anybody is curious, just head over to wptavern.com and search for this episode. Really an absolute pleasure talking to you. I&#8217;ve learned a lot. I&#8217;ve definitely got a much greater, more concrete understanding of exactly what the WPCC is, and hopefully you will get some more interest as a result of this podcast.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Courtney, Sé, thank you so much for joining me today. I really appreciate it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:47:27] Courtney Robertson: Thank you Nathan.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:47:28] Sé Reed: Thank you Nathan.</p>\n</div>\n\n\n\n<p>On the podcast today, we have <a href=\"https://twitter.com/sereedmedia\">Sé Reed</a> and <a href=\"https://twitter.com/courtneyr_dev\">Courtney Robertson</a>, and they’re here to talk about the <a href=\"https://www.thewpcommunitycollective.com/\">WP Community Collective</a>, or WPCC for short.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In a nutshell, the WPCC is a non-profit that is hoping to fund contributors to the WordPress project. It’s been said before, but I’ll say it again, people who can afford to contribute to the WordPress project are the people who can literally afford to contribute to WordPress. This sounds obvious, but think about it for a minute.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Most of us know WordPress is built on top of a dedicated base of volunteers. People give up their time and expertise to contribute towards the project, and in this way make it free to download and use. But we all have to earn money at some point. Most are not in a position to donate their time completely freely; they have to put food on the table.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Often contributors are sponsored by the companies that they work for, either part time or full time. There’s nothing wrong with this model, but what about the capable, willing volunteers who are not in this position? The people who have the skills and motivation to contribute, but not the time or finances to make that a reality.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The WPCC wants to act as a go between for companies or organisations who are willing to spend money improving WordPress, and the individuals who can implement those improvements.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This enterprise will be done via the WPCC fellowships. A fellowship in a specific area of WordPress is created, for example, an accessibility fellowship. People apply for that fellowship, and if successful, get the finances they need to take on the work.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This means that individuals don’t need to be working for an organisation which funds them directly, and the organisations which wish to contribute don’t need to fund only their own team members.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We talk about where the WPCC is at with their fellowships, and how it’s set up so that all participants are fully aware of where the money is being invested.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you’re from a company who would like to assist contributors to WordPress, or an individual wishing to get involved, this episode is for you.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Useful links.</h2>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.thewpcommunitycollective.com/\">WP Community Collective (WPCC) website</a></p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://wpwatercooler.com/\">WP Watercooler podcast</a></p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://phoenix.wordcamp.org/2023/\">WordCamp Phoenix</a></p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.godaddy.com/en-uk/pro/hub-dashboard\">GoDaddy Pro</a></p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/marketing/\">Make Marketing Team</a></p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://learn.wordpress.org/\">Learn WordPress website</a></p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://opencollective.com/thewpcc\">WPCC on the Open Collective website</a></p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://opencollective.com/\">Open Collective website</a></p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://courtneyr.dev/\">courtneyr.dev &#8211; Courtney&#8217;s website</a></p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://twitter.com/courtneyr_dev\">Courtney&#8217;s Twitter</a></p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://twitter.com/sereedmedia\">Sé&#8217;s Twitter</a></p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Wed, 08 Mar 2023 15:00:00 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:14:\"Nathan Wrigley\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:47;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:54:\"WPTavern: WP Engine Pattern Manager Plugin Now in Beta\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:30:\"https://wptavern.com/?p=142504\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:65:\"https://wptavern.com/wp-engine-pattern-manager-plugin-now-in-beta\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:6877:\"<p>WP Engine is <a href=\"https://wpengine.com/builders/pattern-manager/\">beta testing</a> its new Pattern Manager plugin for creating and maintaining patterns. The plugin is intended for WordPress professionals &#8211; developers, agencies, and freelancers, who could benefit from having an interface and system for pattern management. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;There are some plugins out there that provide an interface for creating patterns on a production site, but this is not built for that,&#8221; WP Engine Principal Engineer Mike McAlister said. &#8220;This is meant to slide into a dev workflow where you’re creating, editing, managing patterns for a client, for release in a theme, etc.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Plugins like <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/control-block-patterns/\">Build &amp; Control Block Patterns</a> (2k active installs) and <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/mywp-custom-patterns/\">MyWP Block Pattern</a> (200 active installs) allow users to build block patterns from the admin instead of writing code for them. They offer features like saving page content made with blocks into a pattern, unregistering block patterns, creating custom pattern categories, and more. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>After taking WP Engine&#8217;s Pattern Manager for a test run, it&#8217;s clear that the emphasis in this plugin is going to be more on pattern organization than on the builder aspect. After activating the plugin, clicking on the Patterns screen takes you to a catalogue of all the existing patterns, based on the site&#8217;s active theme. They are organized by category and are also searchable. </p>\n\n\n\n<img />\n\n\n\n<p>I installed the plugin alongside a theme with more than 30 block patterns included to get a better feel for how it works. From the main pattern management screen users can edit, duplicate, and delete existing patterns. Clicking through to edit a pattern lets users add their own pattern categories, keywords, extended description, designate which post types the pattern shows up in, and optionally hide the pattern from the inserter.</p>\n\n\n\n<img />\n\n\n\n<p>Pattern creation happens on its own dedicated screen, which works just like the block editor but with the pattern-specific settings in the sidebar. Once a pattern is saved, it will appear with the others on the pattern management screen. The pattern is attached to the theme, so users should understand that they will not have access to their custom patterns if they activate a different theme.</p>\n\n\n\n<img />\n\n\n\n<p>Users might be curious about creating patterns directly in the block editor. After putting some blocks together in an artful arrangement, it might be convenient to be able to save them as a new pattern for the theme. McAlister said this is not currently possible but it is under consideration.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;Right now, pattern creation is limited to the Pattern Manager UI, where we can do some interesting and powerful things under the hood,&#8221; he said. &#8220;That doesn&#8217;t mean we won&#8217;t one day be able to do it inline, but in terms of exploring this concept as a workflow enhancement, we&#8217;ve limited it to a specific screen.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>After launching the beta, web designer Wolfgang Stefani <a href=\"https://twitter.com/wolfgegenlicht/status/1627881988903559169\">asked</a> on Twitter if it is possible to update patterns globally using the plugin. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;No, not yet,&#8221; McAlister responded. &#8220;It’s not a shortcoming of the plugin, rather how WP treats patterns right now. However, this will be possible with patterns soon, probably sometime this year.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Although there are many additional feature requests that might benefit developers and designers&#8217; workflows, the plugin&#8217;s creators are launching the beta to test the waters and see how users fare with this initial set of features.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;Certainly parts of this workflow are opinionated, based on how we’re building patterns, but we’re doing this beta to understand how other folks are building,&#8221; McAlister said. &#8220;We’re open to any and all feedback to improve the overall workflow.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In a recent post titled &#8220;<a href=\"https://olliewp.com/patterns-are-gonna-be-a-game-changer-for-wordpress/\">Patterns are gonna be a game changer for WordPress</a>,&#8221; McAlister outlined his vision for how pattern functionality could be expanded in WordPress.</p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\">\n<p>What if, for starters, patterns were a treated more like intelligent components? What if instead of being treated as <em>just</em> a collection of blocks, patterns were an entity that WordPress could use as a conduit to do more advanced site building?</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>McAlister explored a few ideas, such as making patterns more like template parts, globally synced and editable, adding pattern locking, and adding the ability to build style variations for patterns. The future is wide open for patterns to become far more useful than they currently are today, and third-party developers are exploring how they can extend this feature that has become so indispensable to building pages with WordPress.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>WP Engine&#8217;s Pattern Manager fits in nicely into the admin interface, almost like a natural part of core, but the top-level menu for Patterns seems too prominent and should be relocated under Appearance. After testing the plugin, I can see how it could become a valuable tool for managing pattern visibility for clients and speeding up page building by offering a more organized system for patterns. The CMS use case is strong here. Agencies that build the same kinds of sites over and over again could benefit from using this tool to quickly add and duplicate custom block patterns and restrict those that don&#8217;t make sense in certain parts of a client-managed site.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>During the live product demo for WordPress 6.2, a viewer asked if core will be adding more robust pattern management capabilities in the future à la WP Engine&#8217;s Pattern Manager plugin. The response was that this is a possibility for the future but is not currently a strong priority.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In the meantime, WP Engine plans to release the plugin for free on WordPress.org after testing with users and updating it based on feedback.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;We have no plans of monetizing,&#8221; McAlister said. &#8220;Right now, we’re more interested in digging into the developer workflow and finding unique solutions we can offer to folks who are digging into these modern WordPress tools.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you want to get in on the beta program, you can <a href=\"https://wpengine.com/builders/pattern-manager/\">sign up</a> to get access to a zip file of the plugin. Your feedback may be incorporated into future versions of the plugin that will eventually land on WordPress.org.</p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Tue, 07 Mar 2023 23:32:32 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"Sarah Gooding\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:48;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:83:\"Do The Woo Community: What the WordPress Community Loved About WordCamp Asia Part 2\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:28:\"https://dothewoo.io/?p=74607\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:82:\"https://dothewoo.io/what-the-wordpress-community-loved-about-wordcamp-asia-part-2/\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:415:\"<p>Part 2 where we hear from attendees, post-WordCamp, on their experiences at WordCamp Asia 2023.</p>\n<p>&gt;&gt; The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://dothewoo.io/what-the-wordpress-community-loved-about-wordcamp-asia-part-2/\">What the WordPress Community Loved About WordCamp Asia Part 2</a> appeared first on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://dothewoo.io\">Do the Woo - a WooCommerce Builder Community</a>	.</p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Tue, 07 Mar 2023 10:16:00 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:5:\"BobWP\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:49;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:83:\"WPTavern: WordPress’ Legacy Default Themes Updated to Bundle Google Fonts Locally\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:30:\"https://wptavern.com/?p=142491\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:91:\"https://wptavern.com/wordpress-legacy-default-themes-updated-to-bundle-google-fonts-locally\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:2311:\"<p>WordPress contributors have updated the legacy default themes to bundle Google Fonts locally in the theme folder, instead of loading them from Google&#8217;s servers. In years past, loading fonts from the the Google CDN was the recommended practice for performance reasons, but new privacy concerns have emerged following a German court case, which <a href=\"https://wptavern.com/german-court-fines-website-owner-for-violating-the-gdpr-by-using-google-hosted-fonts\">fined a website owner for violating the GDPR by using Google-hosted webfonts</a>, </p>\n\n\n\n<p>All of the default themes from Twenty Twelve to Twenty Seventeen have been updated. The process began nine month ago but the approach took some time for contributors to refine. Updates to default themes are usually done in coordination with major and minor releases of WordPress, as core contributor Jonathan Desrosiers explained in the <a href=\"https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/55985\">ticket</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;The reason the updates are usually coordinated is that the themes are usually updated to be compatible with new versions of WordPress, so releasing at the same time makes a lot of sense,&#8221; Desrosiers said. &#8220;Also, the number of contributors that focus on the tickets within the Bundled Themes component is usually very low unless these compatibility issues are being addressed.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>A dev note to accompany these updates to the legacy default themes was <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/themes/2022/07/28/using-locally-hosted-google-fonts-in-themes/\">published</a> to WordPress.org. It contains code examples for serving a new stylesheet from the theme directory, fixing the editor style within a custom theme-setup function, removing the font stylesheet, and including a custom set of fonts in a child theme. This change particularly impacts those who have edited or removed the font stylesheet in a child theme of these default themes or a plugin. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>WordPress&#8217; Themes Team has strongly <a href=\"https://wptavern.com/wordpress-org-strongly-urges-theme-authors-to-switch-to-locally-hosted-webfonts\">urged theme authors to switch to locally hosted webfonts</a>, and is expected to officially ban remotely hosted fonts following WordPress&#8217; legacy default themes getting updated. </p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Tue, 07 Mar 2023 03:19:52 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"Sarah Gooding\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}}}}}}}}}}}}s:4:\"type\";i:128;s:7:\"headers\";O:42:\"Requests_Utility_CaseInsensitiveDictionary\":1:{s:7:\"\0*\0data\";a:8:{s:6:\"server\";s:5:\"nginx\";s:4:\"date\";s:29:\"Tue, 28 Mar 2023 01:14:13 GMT\";s:12:\"content-type\";s:8:\"text/xml\";s:13:\"last-modified\";s:29:\"Tue, 28 Mar 2023 00:45:28 GMT\";s:4:\"vary\";s:15:\"Accept-Encoding\";s:15:\"x-frame-options\";s:10:\"SAMEORIGIN\";s:16:\"content-encoding\";s:4:\"gzip\";s:4:\"x-nc\";s:9:\"HIT ord 2\";}}s:5:\"build\";s:14:\"20211220193300\";}', 'no');
